BECAUSE YOU WERE SLEEPING INSTEAD OF CONQUERING THE LOVELY ROSE PRINCESS HAS BECOME A FIDDLE WITHOUT A BOW WHILE POOR SHAGGY SITS THERE A COOING DOVE (1272-135031-0000)
HE HAS GONE AND GONE FOR GOOD ANSWERED POLYCHROME WHO HAD MANAGED TO SQUEEZE INTO THE ROOM BESIDE THE DRAGON AND HAD WITNESSED THE OCCURRENCES WITH MUCH INTEREST (1272-135031-0001)
I HAVE REMAINED A PRISONER ONLY BECAUSE I WISHED TO BE ONE AND WITH THIS HE STEPPED FORWARD AND BURST THE STOUT CHAINS AS EASILY AS IF THEY HAD BEEN THREADS (1272-135031-0002)
THE LITTLE GIRL HAD BEEN ASLEEP BUT SHE HEARD THE RAPS AND OPENED THE DOOR (1272-135031-0003)
THE KING HAS FLED IN DISGRACE AND YOUR FRIENDS ARE ASKING FOR YOU (1272-135031-0004)
I BEGGED RUGGEDO LONG AGO TO SEND HIM AWAY BUT HE WOULD NOT DO SO (1272-135031-0005)
I ALSO OFFERED TO HELP YOUR BROTHER TO ESCAPE BUT HE WOULD NOT GO (1272-135031-0006)
HE EATS AND SLEEPS VERY STEADILY REPLIED THE NEW KING (1272-135031-0007)
I HOPE HE DOESN'T WORK TOO HARD SAID SHAGGY (1272-135031-0008)
HE DOESN'T WORK AT ALL (1272-135031-0009)
IN FACT THERE IS NOTHING HE CAN DO IN THESE DOMINIONS AS WELL AS OUR NOMES WHOSE NUMBERS ARE SO GREAT THAT IT WORRIES US TO KEEP THEM ALL BUSY (1272-135031-0010)
NOT EXACTLY RETURNED KALIKO (1272-135031-0011)
WHERE IS MY BROTHER NOW (1272-135031-0012)
INQUIRED SHAGGY IN THE METAL FOREST (1272-135031-0013)
WHERE IS THAT (1272-135031-0014)
THE METAL FOREST IS IN THE GREAT DOMED CAVERN THE LARGEST IN ALL OUR DOMINIONS REPLIED KALIKO (1272-135031-0015)
KALIKO HESITATED (1272-135031-0016)
HOWEVER IF WE LOOK SHARP WE MAY BE ABLE TO DISCOVER ONE OF THESE SECRET WAYS (1272-135031-0017)
OH NO I'M QUITE SURE HE DIDN'T (1272-135031-0018)
THAT'S FUNNY REMARKED BETSY THOUGHTFULLY (1272-135031-0019)
I DON'T BELIEVE ANN KNEW ANY MAGIC OR SHE'D HAVE WORKED IT BEFORE (1272-135031-0020)
I DO NOT KNOW CONFESSED SHAGGY (1272-135031-0021)
TRUE AGREED KALIKO (1272-135031-0022)
KALIKO WENT TO THE BIG GONG AND POUNDED ON IT JUST AS RUGGEDO USED TO DO BUT NO ONE ANSWERED THE SUMMONS (1272-135031-0023)
HAVING RETURNED TO THE ROYAL CAVERN KALIKO FIRST POUNDED THE GONG AND THEN SAT IN THE THRONE WEARING RUGGEDO'S DISCARDED RUBY CROWN AND HOLDING IN HIS HAND THE SCEPTRE WHICH RUGGEDO HAD SO OFTEN THROWN AT HIS HEAD (1272-135031-0024)
A MAN SAID TO THE UNIVERSE SIR I EXIST (1272-141231-0000)
SWEAT COVERED BRION'S BODY TRICKLING INTO THE TIGHT LOINCLOTH THAT WAS THE ONLY GARMENT HE WORE (1272-141231-0001)
THE CUT ON HIS CHEST STILL DRIPPING BLOOD THE ACHE OF HIS OVERSTRAINED EYES EVEN THE SOARING ARENA AROUND HIM WITH THE THOUSANDS OF SPECTATORS WERE TRIVIALITIES NOT WORTH THINKING ABOUT (1272-141231-0002)
HIS INSTANT OF PANIC WAS FOLLOWED BY A SMALL SHARP BLOW HIGH ON HIS CHEST (1272-141231-0003)
ONE MINUTE A VOICE SAID AND THE TIME BUZZER SOUNDED (1272-141231-0004)
A MINUTE IS NOT A VERY LARGE MEASURE OF TIME AND HIS BODY NEEDED EVERY FRACTION OF IT (1272-141231-0005)
THE BUZZER'S WHIRR TRIGGERED HIS MUSCLES INTO COMPLETE RELAXATION (1272-141231-0006)
ONLY HIS HEART AND LUNGS WORKED ON AT A STRONG MEASURED RATE (1272-141231-0007)
HE WAS IN REVERIE SLIDING ALONG THE BORDERS OF CONSCIOUSNESS (1272-141231-0008)
THE CONTESTANTS IN THE TWENTIES NEEDED UNDISTURBED REST THEREFORE NIGHTS IN THE DORMITORIES WERE AS QUIET AS DEATH (1272-141231-0009)
PARTICULARLY SO ON THIS LAST NIGHT WHEN ONLY TWO OF THE LITTLE CUBICLES WERE OCCUPIED THE THOUSANDS OF OTHERS STANDING WITH DARK EMPTY DOORS (1272-141231-0010)
THE OTHER VOICE SNAPPED WITH A HARSH URGENCY CLEARLY USED TO COMMAND (1272-141231-0011)
I'M HERE BECAUSE THE MATTER IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND BRANDD IS THE ONE I MUST SEE NOW STAND ASIDE (1272-141231-0012)
THE TWENTIES (1272-141231-0013)
HE MUST HAVE DRAWN HIS GUN BECAUSE THE INTRUDER SAID QUICKLY PUT THAT AWAY YOU'RE BEING A FOOL OUT (1272-141231-0014)
THERE WAS SILENCE THEN AND STILL WONDERING BRION WAS ONCE MORE ASLEEP (1272-141231-0015)
TEN SECONDS (1272-141231-0016)
HE ASKED THE HANDLER WHO WAS KNEADING HIS ACHING MUSCLES (1272-141231-0017)
A RED HAIRED MOUNTAIN OF A MAN WITH AN APPARENTLY INEXHAUSTIBLE STORE OF ENERGY (1272-141231-0018)
THERE COULD BE LITTLE ART IN THIS LAST AND FINAL ROUND OF FENCING (1272-141231-0019)
JUST THRUST AND PARRY AND VICTORY TO THE STRONGER (1272-141231-0020)
EVERY MAN WHO ENTERED THE TWENTIES HAD HIS OWN TRAINING TRICKS (1272-141231-0021)
THERE APPEARED TO BE AN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WITH THE DEATH TRAUMA AS IF THE TWO WERE INEXTRICABLY LINKED INTO ONE (1272-141231-0022)
THE STRENGTH THAT ENABLES SOMEONE IN A TRANCE TO HOLD HIS BODY STIFF AND UNSUPPORTED EXCEPT AT TWO POINTS THE HEAD AND HEELS (1272-141231-0023)
THIS IS PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE WHEN CONSCIOUS (1272-141231-0024)
OTHERS HAD DIED BEFORE DURING THE TWENTIES AND DEATH DURING THE LAST ROUND WAS IN SOME WAYS EASIER THAN DEFEAT (1272-141231-0025)
BREATHING DEEPLY BRION SOFTLY SPOKE THE AUTO HYPNOTIC PHRASES THAT TRIGGERED THE PROCESS (1272-141231-0026)
WHEN THE BUZZER SOUNDED HE PULLED HIS FOIL FROM HIS SECOND'S STARTLED GRASP AND RAN FORWARD (1272-141231-0027)
IROLG LOOKED AMAZED AT THE SUDDEN FURY OF THE ATTACK THEN SMILED (1272-141231-0028)
HE THOUGHT IT WAS A LAST BURST OF ENERGY HE KNEW HOW CLOSE THEY BOTH WERE TO EXHAUSTION (1272-141231-0029)
BRION SAW SOMETHING CLOSE TO PANIC ON HIS OPPONENT'S FACE WHEN THE MAN FINALLY RECOGNIZED HIS ERROR (1272-141231-0030)
A WAVE OF DESPAIR ROLLED OUT FROM IROLG BRION SENSED IT AND KNEW THE FIFTH POINT WAS HIS (1272-141231-0031)
THEN THE POWERFUL TWIST THAT THRUST IT ASIDE IN AND UNDER THE GUARD (1272-141231-0032)
THE LAST TWO DAYS OF THE VOYAGE BARTLEY FOUND ALMOST INTOLERABLE (1462-170142-0000)
EMERGING AT EUSTON AT HALF PAST THREE O'CLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON ALEXANDER HAD HIS LUGGAGE SENT TO THE SAVOY AND DROVE AT ONCE TO BEDFORD SQUARE (1462-170142-0001)
SHE BLUSHED AND SMILED AND FUMBLED HIS CARD IN HER CONFUSION BEFORE SHE RAN UPSTAIRS (1462-170142-0002)
THE ROOM WAS EMPTY WHEN HE ENTERED (1462-170142-0003)
A COAL FIRE WAS CRACKLING IN THE GRATE AND THE LAMPS WERE LIT FOR IT WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GROW DARK OUTSIDE (1462-170142-0004)
SHE CALLED HIS NAME ON THE THRESHOLD BUT IN HER SWIFT FLIGHT ACROSS THE ROOM SHE FELT A CHANGE IN HIM AND CAUGHT HERSELF UP SO DEFTLY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL JUST WHEN SHE DID IT (1462-170142-0005)
SHE MERELY BRUSHED HIS CHEEK WITH HER LIPS AND PUT A HAND LIGHTLY AND JOYOUSLY ON EITHER SHOULDER (1462-170142-0006)
I NEVER DREAMED IT WOULD BE YOU BARTLEY (1462-170142-0007)
WHEN DID YOU COME BARTLEY AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN YOU HAVEN'T SPOKEN A WORD (1462-170142-0008)
SHE LOOKED AT HIS HEAVY SHOULDERS AND BIG DETERMINED HEAD THRUST FORWARD LIKE A CATAPULT IN LEASH (1462-170142-0009)
I'LL DO ANYTHING YOU WISH ME TO BARTLEY SHE SAID TREMULOUSLY (1462-170142-0010)
HE PULLED UP A WINDOW AS IF THE AIR WERE HEAVY (1462-170142-0011)
HILDA WATCHED HIM FROM HER CORNER TREMBLING AND SCARCELY BREATHING DARK SHADOWS GROWING ABOUT HER EYES (1462-170142-0012)
IT IT HASN'T ALWAYS MADE YOU MISERABLE HAS IT (1462-170142-0013)
ALWAYS BUT IT'S WORSE NOW (1462-170142-0014)
IT'S UNBEARABLE IT TORTURES ME EVERY MINUTE (1462-170142-0015)
I AM NOT A MAN WHO CAN LIVE TWO LIVES HE WENT ON FEVERISHLY EACH LIFE SPOILS THE OTHER (1462-170142-0016)
I GET NOTHING BUT MISERY OUT OF EITHER (1462-170142-0017)
THERE IS THIS DECEPTION BETWEEN ME AND EVERYTHING (1462-170142-0018)
AT THAT WORD DECEPTION SPOKEN WITH SUCH SELF CONTEMPT THE COLOR FLASHED BACK INTO HILDA'S FACE AS SUDDENLY AS IF SHE HAD BEEN STRUCK BY A WHIPLASH (1462-170142-0019)
SHE BIT HER LIP AND LOOKED DOWN AT HER HANDS WHICH WERE CLASPED TIGHTLY IN FRONT OF HER (1462-170142-0020)
COULD YOU COULD YOU SIT DOWN AND TALK ABOUT IT QUIETLY BARTLEY AS IF I WERE A FRIEND AND NOT SOME ONE WHO HAD TO BE DEFIED (1462-170142-0021)
HE DROPPED BACK HEAVILY INTO HIS CHAIR BY THE FIRE (1462-170142-0022)
I HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL I AM WORN OUT (1462-170142-0023)
AFTER THE VERY FIRST (1462-170142-0024)
HILDA'S FACE QUIVERED BUT SHE WHISPERED YES I THINK IT MUST HAVE BEEN (1462-170142-0025)
SHE PRESSED HIS HAND GENTLY IN GRATITUDE WEREN'T YOU HAPPY THEN AT ALL (1462-170142-0026)
SOMETHING OF THEIR TROUBLING SWEETNESS CAME BACK TO ALEXANDER TOO (1462-170142-0027)
PRESENTLY IT STOLE BACK TO HIS COAT SLEEVE (1462-170142-0028)
YES HILDA I KNOW THAT HE SAID SIMPLY (1462-170142-0029)
I UNDERSTAND BARTLEY I WAS WRONG (1462-170142-0030)
SHE LISTENED INTENTLY BUT SHE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE CREAKING OF HIS CHAIR (1462-170142-0031)
YOU WANT ME TO SAY IT SHE WHISPERED (1462-170142-0032)
BARTLEY LEANED HIS HEAD IN HIS HANDS AND SPOKE THROUGH HIS TEETH (1462-170142-0033)
IT'S GOT TO BE A CLEAN BREAK HILDA (1462-170142-0034)
OH BARTLEY WHAT AM I TO DO (1462-170142-0035)
YOU ASK ME TO STAY AWAY FROM YOU BECAUSE YOU WANT ME (1462-170142-0036)
I WILL ASK THE LEAST IMAGINABLE BUT I MUST HAVE SOMETHING (1462-170142-0037)
HILDA SAT ON THE ARM OF IT AND PUT HER HANDS LIGHTLY ON HIS SHOULDERS (1462-170142-0038)
YOU SEE LOVING SOME ONE AS I LOVE YOU MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD DIFFERENT (1462-170142-0039)
AND THEN YOU CAME BACK NOT CARING VERY MUCH BUT IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE (1462-170142-0040)
SHE SLID TO THE FLOOR BESIDE HIM AS IF SHE WERE TOO TIRED TO SIT UP ANY LONGER (1462-170142-0041)
DON'T CRY DON'T CRY HE WHISPERED (1462-170142-0042)
ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN APRIL THE NEW YORK TIMES PUBLISHED AN ACCOUNT OF THE STRIKE COMPLICATIONS WHICH WERE DELAYING ALEXANDER'S NEW JERSEY BRIDGE AND STATED THAT THE ENGINEER HIMSELF WAS IN TOWN AND AT HIS OFFICE ON WEST TENTH STREET (1462-170145-0000)
OVER THE FIREPLACE THERE WAS A LARGE OLD FASHIONED GILT MIRROR (1462-170145-0001)
HE ROSE AND CROSSED THE ROOM QUICKLY (1462-170145-0002)
OF COURSE I KNOW BARTLEY SHE SAID AT LAST THAT AFTER THIS YOU WON'T OWE ME THE LEAST CONSIDERATION BUT WE SAIL ON TUESDAY (1462-170145-0003)
I SAW THAT INTERVIEW IN THE PAPER YESTERDAY TELLING WHERE YOU WERE AND I THOUGHT I HAD TO SEE YOU THAT'S ALL GOOD NIGHT I'M GOING NOW (1462-170145-0004)
LET ME TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND YOUR BOOTS THEY'RE OOZING WATER (1462-170145-0005)
IF YOU'D SENT ME A NOTE OR TELEPHONED ME OR ANYTHING (1462-170145-0006)
I TOLD MYSELF THAT IF I WERE REALLY THINKING OF YOU AND NOT OF MYSELF A LETTER WOULD BE BETTER THAN NOTHING (1462-170145-0007)
HE PAUSED THEY NEVER DID TO ME (1462-170145-0008)
OH BARTLEY DID YOU WRITE TO ME (1462-170145-0009)
ALEXANDER SLIPPED HIS ARM ABOUT HER (1462-170145-0010)
I THINK I HAVE FELT THAT YOU WERE COMING (1462-170145-0011)
HE BENT HIS FACE OVER HER HAIR (1462-170145-0012)
AND I SHE WHISPERED I FELT THAT YOU WERE FEELING THAT (1462-170145-0013)
BUT WHEN I CAME I THOUGHT I HAD BEEN MISTAKEN (1462-170145-0014)
I'VE BEEN UP IN CANADA WITH MY BRIDGE AND I ARRANGED NOT TO COME TO NEW YORK UNTIL AFTER YOU HAD GONE (1462-170145-0015)
THEN WHEN YOUR MANAGER ADDED TWO MORE WEEKS I WAS ALREADY COMMITTED (1462-170145-0016)
I'M GOING TO DO WHAT YOU ASKED ME TO DO WHEN YOU WERE IN LONDON (1462-170145-0017)
ONLY I'LL DO IT MORE COMPLETELY (1462-170145-0018)
THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT (1462-170145-0019)
YES I KNOW VERY WELL (1462-170145-0020)
ALEXANDER FLUSHED ANGRILY (1462-170145-0021)
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I OUGHT TO SAY BUT I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'D BE HAPPY TRULY I DON'T AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN ME (1462-170145-0022)
HE HAD NEVER BEEN FATHER LOVER HUSBAND FRIEND (174-168635-0000)
THE HEART OF THAT EX CONVICT WAS FULL OF VIRGINITY (174-168635-0001)
HIS SISTER AND HIS SISTER'S CHILDREN HAD LEFT HIM ONLY A VAGUE AND FAR OFF MEMORY WHICH HAD FINALLY ALMOST COMPLETELY VANISHED HE HAD MADE EVERY EFFORT TO FIND THEM AND NOT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO FIND THEM HE HAD FORGOTTEN THEM (174-168635-0002)
HE SUFFERED ALL THE PANGS OF A MOTHER AND HE KNEW NOT WHAT IT MEANT FOR THAT GREAT AND SINGULAR MOVEMENT OF A HEART WHICH BEGINS TO LOVE IS A VERY OBSCURE AND A VERY SWEET THING (174-168635-0003)
ONLY AS HE WAS FIVE AND FIFTY AND COSETTE EIGHT YEARS OF AGE ALL THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN LOVE IN THE WHOLE COURSE OF HIS LIFE FLOWED TOGETHER INTO A SORT OF INEFFABLE LIGHT (174-168635-0004)
COSETTE ON HER SIDE HAD ALSO UNKNOWN TO HERSELF BECOME ANOTHER BEING POOR LITTLE THING (174-168635-0005)
SHE FELT THAT WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT BEFORE A SENSATION OF EXPANSION (174-168635-0006)
THE MAN NO LONGER PRODUCED ON HER THE EFFECT OF BEING OLD OR POOR SHE THOUGHT JEAN VALJEAN HANDSOME JUST AS SHE THOUGHT THE HOVEL PRETTY (174-168635-0007)
NATURE A DIFFERENCE OF FIFTY YEARS HAD SET A PROFOUND GULF BETWEEN JEAN VALJEAN AND COSETTE DESTINY FILLED IN THIS GULF (174-168635-0008)
TO MEET WAS TO FIND EACH OTHER (174-168635-0009)
WHEN THESE TWO SOULS PERCEIVED EACH OTHER THEY RECOGNIZED EACH OTHER AS NECESSARY TO EACH OTHER AND EMBRACED EACH OTHER CLOSELY (174-168635-0010)
MOREOVER JEAN VALJEAN HAD CHOSEN HIS REFUGE WELL (174-168635-0011)
HE HAD PAID HER SIX MONTHS IN ADVANCE AND HAD COMMISSIONED THE OLD WOMAN TO FURNISH THE CHAMBER AND DRESSING ROOM AS WE HAVE SEEN (174-168635-0012)
WEEK FOLLOWED WEEK THESE TWO BEINGS LED A HAPPY LIFE IN THAT HOVEL (174-168635-0013)
COSETTE WAS NO LONGER IN RAGS SHE WAS IN MOURNING (174-168635-0014)
AND THEN HE TALKED OF HER MOTHER AND HE MADE HER PRAY (174-168635-0015)
HE PASSED HOURS IN WATCHING HER DRESSING AND UNDRESSING HER DOLL AND IN LISTENING TO HER PRATTLE (174-168635-0016)
THE BEST OF US ARE NOT EXEMPT FROM EGOTISTICAL THOUGHTS (174-168635-0017)
HE HAD RETURNED TO PRISON THIS TIME FOR HAVING DONE RIGHT HE HAD QUAFFED FRESH BITTERNESS DISGUST AND LASSITUDE WERE OVERPOWERING HIM EVEN THE MEMORY OF THE BISHOP PROBABLY SUFFERED A TEMPORARY ECLIPSE THOUGH SURE TO REAPPEAR LATER ON LUMINOUS AND TRIUMPHANT BUT AFTER ALL THAT SACRED MEMORY WAS GROWING DIM (174-168635-0018)
WHO KNOWS WHETHER JEAN VALJEAN HAD NOT BEEN ON THE EVE OF GROWING DISCOURAGED AND OF FALLING ONCE MORE (174-168635-0019)
ALAS HE WALKED WITH NO LESS INDECISION THAN COSETTE (174-168635-0020)
HE PROTECTED HER AND SHE STRENGTHENED HIM (174-168635-0021)
HE WAS THAT CHILD'S STAY AND SHE WAS HIS PROP (174-168635-0022)
FUCHS BROUGHT UP A SACK OF POTATOES AND A PIECE OF CURED PORK FROM THE CELLAR AND GRANDMOTHER PACKED SOME LOAVES OF SATURDAY'S BREAD A JAR OF BUTTER AND SEVERAL PUMPKIN PIES IN THE STRAW OF THE WAGON BOX (1988-147956-0000)
OCCASIONALLY ONE OF THE HORSES WOULD TEAR OFF WITH HIS TEETH A PLANT FULL OF BLOSSOMS AND WALK ALONG MUNCHING IT THE FLOWERS NODDING IN TIME TO HIS BITES AS HE ATE DOWN TOWARD THEM (1988-147956-0001)
IT'S NO BETTER THAN A BADGER HOLE NO PROPER DUGOUT AT ALL (1988-147956-0002)
NOW WHY IS THAT OTTO (1988-147956-0003)
PRESENTLY AGAINST ONE OF THOSE BANKS I SAW A SORT OF SHED THATCHED WITH THE SAME WINE COLORED GRASS THAT GREW EVERYWHERE (1988-147956-0004)
VERY GLAD VERY GLAD SHE EJACULATED (1988-147956-0005)
YOU'LL GET FIXED UP COMFORTABLE AFTER WHILE MISSUS SHIMERDA MAKE GOOD HOUSE (1988-147956-0006)
MY GRANDMOTHER ALWAYS SPOKE IN A VERY LOUD TONE TO FOREIGNERS AS IF THEY WERE DEAF (1988-147956-0007)
SHE MADE MISSUS SHIMERDA UNDERSTAND THE FRIENDLY INTENTION OF OUR VISIT AND THE BOHEMIAN WOMAN HANDLED THE LOAVES OF BREAD AND EVEN SMELLED THEM AND EXAMINED THE PIES WITH LIVELY CURIOSITY EXCLAIMING MUCH GOOD MUCH THANK (1988-147956-0008)
THE FAMILY HAD BEEN LIVING ON CORNCAKES AND SORGHUM MOLASSES FOR THREE DAYS (1988-147956-0009)
I REMEMBERED WHAT THE CONDUCTOR HAD SAID ABOUT HER EYES (1988-147956-0010)
HER SKIN WAS BROWN TOO AND IN HER CHEEKS SHE HAD A GLOW OF RICH DARK COLOR (1988-147956-0011)
EVEN FROM A DISTANCE ONE COULD SEE THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT THIS BOY (1988-147956-0012)
HE WAS BORN LIKE THAT THE OTHERS ARE SMART (1988-147956-0013)
AMBROSCH HE MAKE GOOD FARMER (1988-147956-0014)
HE STRUCK AMBROSCH ON THE BACK AND THE BOY SMILED KNOWINGLY (1988-147956-0015)
AT THAT MOMENT THE FATHER CAME OUT OF THE HOLE IN THE BANK (1988-147956-0016)
IT WAS SO LONG THAT IT BUSHED OUT BEHIND HIS EARS AND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE THE OLD PORTRAITS I REMEMBERED IN VIRGINIA (1988-147956-0017)
I NOTICED HOW WHITE AND WELL SHAPED HIS OWN HANDS WERE (1988-147956-0018)
WE STOOD PANTING ON THE EDGE OF THE RAVINE LOOKING DOWN AT THE TREES AND BUSHES THAT GREW BELOW US (1988-147956-0019)
THE WIND WAS SO STRONG THAT I HAD TO HOLD MY HAT ON AND THE GIRLS SKIRTS WERE BLOWN OUT BEFORE THEM (1988-147956-0020)
SHE LOOKED AT ME HER EYES FAIRLY BLAZING WITH THINGS SHE COULD NOT SAY (1988-147956-0021)
SHE POINTED INTO THE GOLD COTTONWOOD TREE BEHIND WHOSE TOP WE STOOD AND SAID AGAIN WHAT NAME (1988-147956-0022)
ANTONIA POINTED UP TO THE SKY AND QUESTIONED ME WITH HER GLANCE (1988-147956-0023)
SHE GOT UP ON HER KNEES AND WRUNG HER HANDS (1988-147956-0024)
SHE WAS QUICK AND VERY EAGER (1988-147956-0025)
WE WERE SO DEEP IN THE GRASS THAT WE COULD SEE NOTHING BUT THE BLUE SKY OVER US AND THE GOLD TREE IN FRONT OF US (1988-147956-0026)
AFTER ANTONIA HAD SAID THE NEW WORDS OVER AND OVER SHE WANTED TO GIVE ME A LITTLE CHASED SILVER RING SHE WORE ON HER MIDDLE FINGER (1988-147956-0027)
WHEN I CAME UP HE TOUCHED MY SHOULDER AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY DOWN INTO MY FACE FOR SEVERAL SECONDS (1988-147956-0028)
I BECAME SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED FOR I WAS USED TO BEING TAKEN FOR GRANTED BY MY ELDERS (1988-147956-0029)

THE BARREN ROCK ABOUT THREE MILES IN LENGTH WAS COVERED WITH MONASTIC BUILDINGS AND ITS CEMETERY WAS ALREADY ADORNED WITH THE TOMBS OF SAINTS AND KINGS (2035-152373-0011)
NOW EVERY MISSIONARY THAT EVER WENT OUT FROM IONA HAD TAUGHT THAT TO REDUCE CHRISTIANS TO SLAVERY WAS WHOLLY INCONSISTENT WITH A BELIEF IN THE DOCTRINES OF THE GOSPEL (2035-152373-0012)
WHILE THE LIBERATED EXILES REJOICED ON THE PLAIN OF MEATH THE TENT OF THE ABBOT OF IONA WAS PITCHED ON THE RATH OF TARA A FACT WHICH WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE THAT ALREADY IN LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY SINCE THE INTERDICT HAD FALLEN ON IT THE EDIFICES WHICH MADE SO FINE A SHOW IN THE DAYS OF PATRICK WERE RUINED AND UNINHABITABLE (2035-152373-0013)

I WAS DELIGHTED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE MANNER OF LIFE (2412-153948-0005)
I WAS TO SEE THE SHEEP NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AT HAND NOR TO GET THEM IN A SINGLE MOB BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EASY THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFICULT MATTER FOR THERE WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BREEDING EWES THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET (2412-153948-0006)

I WOULD TRY THE NEARER RANGE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO (2412-153948-0015)
I IMAGINE THERE WERE SEVERAL KINDS OF OLD FASHIONED CHRISTMASES BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WORSE THAN A CHOP IN MY CHAMBERS OR HORROR OF HORRORS AT THE CLUB OR MY COUSIN LUCY'S NOTION OF WHAT SHE CALLS THE FESTIVE SEASON (2428-83699-0000)

MASS SUICIDE THAT'S WHAT IT WAS NOTICE WHAT'S IN THE CORNERS (251-136532-0013)

THE TERRAN PUBLIC WANTED TO HEAR ABOUT MARTIANS AND IF LIVE MARTIANS COULDN'T BE FOUND A ROOM FULL OF DEAD ONES WAS THE NEXT BEST THING (251-136532-0016)
TONY LATTIMER THE DISCOVERER WAS BEGINNING TO CASH IN ON HIS ATTENTIONS TO GLORIA AND HIS INGRATIATION WITH SID HE WAS ALWAYS EITHER MAKING VOICE AND IMAGE TALKS FOR TELECAST OR LISTENING TO THE NEWS FROM THE HOME PLANET (251-136532-0017)
WITHOUT QUESTION HE HAD BECOME OVERNIGHT THE MOST WIDELY KNOWN ARCHAEOLOGIST IN HISTORY (251-136532-0018)
NOT THAT I'M INTERESTED IN ALL THIS FOR MYSELF HE DISCLAIMED AFTER LISTENING TO THE TELECAST FROM TERRA TWO DAYS AFTER HIS DISCOVERY (251-136532-0019)
BRING IT TO THE PUBLIC ATTENTION DRAMATIZE IT (251-136532-0020)

FORTUNATELY WILL HALLEY WAS NOT A MAN IN A HURRY AND DID NOT USE A PRESS OF CANVAS OR HIS MASTS WOULD INEVITABLY HAVE COME DOWN (2803-154320-0000)
JOHN MANGLES THEREFORE HOPED THAT THE WRETCHED HULL WOULD REACH PORT WITHOUT ACCIDENT BUT IT GRIEVED HIM THAT HIS COMPANIONS SHOULD HAVE TO SUFFER SO MUCH DISCOMFORT FROM THE DEFECTIVE ARRANGEMENTS OF THE BRIG (2803-154320-0001)
THEIR FRIENDS DID THEIR BEST TO AMUSE THEM (2803-154320-0002)
THEIR MINDS WERE SO DISTRACTED AT THIS CHANGE OF ROUTE AS TO BE QUITE UNHINGED (2803-154320-0003)
MUCH AS THEY HAD BEEN INTERESTED IN HIS DISSERTATION ON THE PAMPAS OR AUSTRALIA HIS LECTURES ON NEW ZEALAND FELL ON COLD AND INDIFFERENT EARS (2803-154320-0004)
HIS EYES WANDERED CEASELESSLY OVER THE BLANK HORIZON (2803-154320-0005)
WHAT THEN MY LORD (2803-154320-0006)
GOD KEEP US FROM SUCH A MEETING WHY JOHN (2803-154320-0007)
WE COULD NOT EVEN FLY FLY JOHN (2803-154320-0008)
YES MY LORD WE SHOULD TRY IN VAIN (2803-154320-0009)
WE WOULD FIGHT TO THE DEATH OF COURSE BUT AFTER THAT (2803-154320-0010)
THINK OF LADY GLENARVAN THINK OF MARY GRANT (2803-154320-0011)
WILL HALLEY IS A BRUTE BUT I AM KEEPING MY EYES OPEN AND IF THE COAST LOOKS DANGEROUS I WILL PUT THE SHIP'S HEAD TO SEA AGAIN (2803-154320-0012)
SO THAT ON THAT SCORE THERE IS LITTLE OR NO DANGER (2803-154320-0013)
BUT AS TO GETTING ALONGSIDE THE DUNCAN GOD FORBID (2803-154320-0014)
ONCE THERE WAS A FATHER WHO THOUGHT HE WOULD BUILD FOR HIS CHILDREN A BEAUTIFUL HOME PUTTING INTO IT EVERY THING THEY COULD NEED OR DESIRE THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES (2803-161169-0000)
THE SWEETEST PERFUMES FLOATED THROUGH THE AIR WHILE THOUSANDS OF BIRDS ANSWERED THE MUSIC OF FOUNTAINS WITH THEIR SONGS (2803-161169-0001)
WHY DID HE GIVE THAT SO ODD A SHAPE OR SO STRANGE A COVERING (2803-161169-0002)
AND SO THROUGH MANY QUESTIONS AND MANY EXPERIMENTS THEY LEARN AT LAST HOW TO USE THE CONTENTS OF THIS ONE STOREHOUSE (2803-161169-0003)
THE ENTRANCE IS LIGHT BECAUSE IT OPENS SO WIDE BUT WE CAN SEE THAT THE FLOOR SLOPES DOWNWARD AND THE WAY LOOKS DARK AND NARROW BEFORE US (2803-161169-0004)
WALK DOWN THE SLOPING FOOT PATH NOW AND BE CAREFUL TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF THE LITTLE CARS THAT ARE COMING AND GOING ON EACH SIDE OF YOU LOADED ON ONE SIDE AND EMPTY ON THE OTHER AND SEEMING TO RUN UP AND DOWN BY THEMSELVES (2803-161169-0005)
LOOK A LITTLE CLOSER WHILE OUR GUIDE LETS THE LIGHT OF HIS LAMP FALL UPON THE BLACK WALL AT YOUR SIDE (2803-161169-0006)
SEE BENEATH YOUR FEET IS THE MARKING OF GREAT TREE TRUNKS LYING ASLANT ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE FORMS OF GIGANTIC PALM LEAVES STREWED AMONG THEM (2803-161169-0007)
HERE IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT ROUNDED LIKE A NUT SHELL YOU CAN SPLIT OFF ONE SIDE AND BEHOLD THERE IS THE NUT LYING SNUGLY AS DOES ANY CHESTNUT IN ITS BUR (2803-161169-0008)
FERNS AND PALMS MOSSES AND TREES AND ANIMALS ALL PERFECT ALL BEAUTIFUL AND YET ALL HIDDEN AWAY UNDER THIS HILL AND TURNED INTO SHINING BLACK COAL NOW I CAN VERY WELL REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW A COAL FIRE AND HOW ODD IT LOOKED TO SEE WHAT SEEMED TO BE BURNING STONES (2803-161169-0009)
FOR WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE ALWAYS HAD LOGS OF WOOD BLAZING IN AN OPEN FIREPLACE AND SO DID MANY OTHER PEOPLE AND COAL WAS JUST COMING INTO USE FOR FUEL (2803-161169-0010)
WHAT SHOULD WE HAVE DONE IF EVERYBODY HAD KEPT ON BURNING WOOD TO THIS DAY (2803-161169-0011)
THESE FORESTS WERE OF TREES DIFFERENT IN SOME WAYS FROM THOSE WE HAVE NOW GREAT FERNS AS TALL AS THIS HOUSE AND MOSSES AS HIGH AS LITTLE TREES AND PALM LEAVES OF ENORMOUS SIZE (2803-161169-0012)
THEN THE HILLS WERE PILED UP ON TOP OF IT ALL BUT HERE AND THERE SOME EDGE OF A COAL BED WAS TILTED UP AND APPEARED ABOVE THE GROUND (2803-161169-0013)
BUT BY AND BY THE WISE MEN THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND SAID TO THEMSELVES WE MUST FIND OUT WHAT USEFUL PURPOSE GOD MADE THE GAS FOR WE KNOW THAT HE DOES NOT MAKE ANY THING FOR HARM ONLY (2803-161169-0014)
IT WAS ONLY A TROUBLE TO THE GAS MAKERS WHO HAD NO USE FOR IT AND EVEN THREW IT AWAY UNTIL SOME ONE MORE THOUGHTFUL THAN THE OTHERS FOUND OUT THAT WATER WOULD NOT PASS THROUGH IT (2803-161169-0015)
DON'T YOU SEE HOW MANY USES WE HAVE FOUND FOR THIS REFUSE COAL TAR (2803-161169-0016)

SHASTA RAMBLES AND MODOC MEMORIES (3000-15664-0000)
ARCTIC BEAUTY AND DESOLATION WITH THEIR BLESSINGS AND DANGERS ALL MAY BE FOUND HERE TO TEST THE ENDURANCE AND SKILL OF ADVENTUROUS CLIMBERS BUT FAR BETTER THAN CLIMBING THE MOUNTAIN IS GOING AROUND ITS WARM FERTILE BASE ENJOYING ITS BOUNTIES LIKE A BEE CIRCLING AROUND A BANK OF FLOWERS (3000-15664-0001)
PERHAPS THE PROFESSION OF DOING GOOD MAY BE FULL BUT EVERY BODY SHOULD BE KIND AT LEAST TO HIMSELF (3000-15664-0002)
GO QUIETLY ALONE NO HARM WILL BEFALL YOU (3000-15664-0003)
BUT IT IS FAR BETTER TO GO AFOOT (3000-15664-0004)
ONE BLANKET WILL BE ENOUGH TO CARRY OR YOU MAY FOREGO THE PLEASURE AND BURDEN ALTOGETHER AS WOOD FOR FIRES IS EVERYWHERE ABUNDANT (3000-15664-0005)
ONLY A LITTLE FOOD WILL BE REQUIRED (3000-15664-0006)
THUS ONE SAUNTERS ON AND ON IN THE GLORIOUS RADIANCE IN UTTER PEACE AND FORGETFULNESS OF TIME (3000-15664-0007)
YET STRANGE TO SAY THERE ARE DAYS EVEN HERE SOMEWHAT DULL LOOKING WHEN THE MOUNTAIN SEEMS UNCOMMUNICATIVE SENDING OUT NO APPRECIABLE INVITATION AS IF NOT AT HOME (3000-15664-0008)
AT SUCH TIME ITS HEIGHT SEEMS MUCH LESS AS IF CROUCHING AND WEARY IT WERE TAKING REST (3000-15664-0009)
EVERY CRYSTAL DANCES RESPONSIVE TO THE TOUCHES OF THE SUN AND CURRENTS OF SAP IN THE GROWING CELLS OF ALL THE VEGETATION ARE EVER IN A VITAL WHIRL AND RUSH AND THOUGH MANY FEET AND WINGS ARE FOLDED HOW MANY ARE ASTIR (3000-15664-0010)
SLIGHT RAINSTORMS ARE LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN A TRIP ROUND THE MOUNTAIN BUT ONE MAY EASILY FIND SHELTER BENEATH WELL THATCHED TREES THAT SHED THE RAIN LIKE A ROOF (3000-15664-0011)
THEN THE SHINING OF THE WET LEAVES IS DELIGHTFUL AND THE STEAMY FRAGRANCE AND THE BURST OF BIRD SONG FROM A MULTITUDE OF THRUSHES AND FINCHES AND WARBLERS THAT HAVE NESTS IN THE CHAPARRAL (3000-15664-0012)
A THOUSAND THOUSAND VOICES ARE HEARD BUT SO FINELY BLENDED THEY SEEM A PART OF THE NIGHT ITSELF AND MAKE A DEEPER SILENCE (3000-15664-0013)
IN SETTING OUT FROM STRAWBERRY VALLEY BY BEARING OFF TO THE NORTHWESTWARD A FEW MILES YOU MAY SEE (3000-15664-0014)
IN APPROACHING IT ITS SUSPICIOUS LOOKING YELLOW SPOTTED HOOD AND WATCHFUL ATTITUDE WILL BE LIKELY TO MAKE YOU GO CAUTIOUSLY THROUGH THE BOG WHERE IT STANDS AS IF YOU WERE APPROACHING A DANGEROUS SNAKE (3000-15664-0015)
IT IS LINED WITH EMERALD ALGAE AND MOSSES AND SHADED WITH ALDER WILLOW AND THORN BUSHES WHICH GIVE IT A FINE SETTING (3000-15664-0016)
IT IS THREE OR FOUR MILES LONG AND TERMINATES AT AN ELEVATION OF ABOUT NINE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL IN MORAINE SPRINKLED ICE CLIFFS SIXTY FEET HIGH (3000-15664-0017)
THE LONG GRAY SLOPES LEADING UP TO THE GLACIER SEEM REMARKABLY SMOOTH AND UNBROKEN (3000-15664-0018)
MOST OF THE DRAINAGE OF THE GLACIER VANISHES AT ONCE IN THE POROUS ROCKS TO REAPPEAR IN SPRINGS IN THE DISTANT VALLEY AND IT IS ONLY IN TIME OF FLOOD THAT THE CHANNEL CARRIES MUCH WATER THEN THERE ARE SEVERAL FINE FALLS IN THE GORGE SIX HUNDRED FEET OR MORE IN HEIGHT (3000-15664-0019)
TRACING THIS WILD CHANGING CHANNEL GORGE GULLY OR CANYON THE SECTIONS WILL SHOW MOUNT SHASTA AS A HUGE PALIMPSEST CONTAINING THE RECORDS LAYER UPON LAYER OF STRANGELY CONTRASTED EVENTS IN ITS FIERY ICY HISTORY (3000-15664-0020)
REGAINING THE LOW GROUND AT THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN AND HOLDING ON IN YOUR GRAND ORBIT YOU PASS THROUGH A BELT OF JUNIPER WOODS CALLED THE CEDARS TO SHEEP ROCK AT THE FOOT OF THE SHASTA PASS (3000-15664-0021)
HERE YOU STRIKE THE OLD EMIGRANT ROAD WHICH LEADS OVER THE LOW DIVIDE TO THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAIN (3000-15664-0022)
MOUNT BREMER IS THE MOST NOTED STRONGHOLD OF THE SHEEP IN THE WHOLE SHASTA REGION (3000-15664-0023)
LARGE FLOCKS DWELL HERE FROM YEAR TO YEAR WINTER AND SUMMER DESCENDING OCCASIONALLY INTO THE ADJACENT SAGE PLAINS AND LAVA BEDS TO FEED BUT EVER READY TO TAKE REFUGE IN THE JAGGED CRAGS OF THEIR MOUNTAIN AT EVERY ALARM (3000-15664-0024)
WHILE TRAVELING WITH A COMPANY OF HUNTERS I SAW ABOUT FIFTY IN ONE FLOCK (3000-15664-0025)
THE MULE DEER ARE NEARLY AS HEAVY (3000-15664-0026)
THEIR LONG MASSIVE EARS GIVE THEM A VERY STRIKING APPEARANCE (3000-15664-0027)
BUT NEITHER THE GLORIFIED WOODS ON THE ONE HAND NOR THE LAKE ON THE OTHER COULD AT FIRST HOLD THE EYE (3000-15664-0028)
THEN FELL THE GLOAMING MAKING EVERYTHING STILL MORE FORBIDDING AND MYSTERIOUS (3000-15664-0029)
THEN DARKNESS LIKE DEATH (3000-15664-0030)
TWO OR THREE MILES FARTHER ON IS THE MAIN STRONGHOLD OF THE MODOCS HELD BY THEM SO LONG AND DEFIANTLY AGAINST ALL THE SOLDIERS THAT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE ATTACK (3000-15664-0031)
THE DUCKS LESS WARY KEPT THEIR PLACES MERELY SWIMMING IN AND OUT THROUGH OPENINGS IN THE RUSHES RIPPLING THE GLASSY WATER AND RAISING SPANGLES IN THEIR WAKE (3000-15664-0032)
THEY ARE BROAD RUGGED CREVASSED CLOUDLIKE MASSES OF DOWN GRINDING ICE POURING FORTH STREAMS OF MUDDY WATER AS MEASURES OF THE WORK THEY ARE DOING IN SCULPTURING THE ROCKS BENEATH THEM VERY UNLIKE THE LONG MAJESTIC GLACIERS OF ALASKA THAT RIVERLIKE GO WINDING DOWN THE VALLEYS THROUGH THE FORESTS TO THE SEA (3000-15664-0033)
THUS THE SHASTA RIVER ISSUES FROM A LARGE LAKE LIKE SPRING IN SHASTA VALLEY AND ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THE VOLUME OF THE MC CLOUD GUSHES FORTH IN A GRAND SPRING ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN A FEW MILES BACK FROM ITS IMMEDIATE BASE (3000-15664-0034)
SHOULD THE VOLUME OF THE STREAM WHERE YOU STRIKE IT SEEM SMALL THEN YOU WILL KNOW THAT YOU ARE ABOVE THE SPRING IF LARGE NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS VOLUME AT ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT RIVER THEN YOU ARE BELOW IT AND IN EITHER CASE HAVE ONLY TO FOLLOW THE RIVER UP OR DOWN UNTIL YOU COME TO IT (3000-15664-0035)
UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS YOU MAY HEAR THE ROAR OF THE WATER RUSHING FROM THE ROCK AT A DISTANCE OF HALF A MILE OR EVEN MORE OR YOU MAY NOT HEAR IT UNTIL WITHIN A FEW RODS (3000-15664-0036)
THE VIVID GREEN OF THE BOULDERS BENEATH THE WATER IS VERY STRIKING AND COLORS THE ENTIRE STREAM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE PORTIONS BROKEN INTO FOAM (3000-15664-0037)
ASPLENIUM EPILOBIUM HEUCHERA HAZEL DOGWOOD AND ALDER MAKE A LUXURIOUS FRINGE AND SETTING AND THE FORESTS OF DOUGLAS SPRUCE ALONG THE BANKS ARE THE FINEST I HAVE EVER SEEN IN THE SIERRA (3000-15664-0038)
TRACING RIVERS TO THEIR FOUNTAINS MAKES THE MOST CHARMING OF TRAVELS (3000-15664-0039)
AS THE LIFE BLOOD OF THE LANDSCAPES THE BEST OF THE WILDERNESS COMES TO THEIR BANKS AND NOT ONE DULL PASSAGE IS FOUND IN ALL THEIR EVENTFUL HISTORIES (3000-15664-0040)
TRACING THE MC CLOUD TO ITS HIGHEST SPRINGS AND OVER THE DIVIDE TO THE FOUNTAINS OF FALL RIVER NEAR FORT CROOK THENCE DOWN THAT RIVER TO ITS CONFLUENCE WITH THE PITT ON FROM THERE TO THE VOLCANIC REGION ABOUT LASSEN'S BUTTE THROUGH THE BIG MEADOWS AMONG THE SOURCES OF THE FEATHER RIVER AND DOWN THROUGH FORESTS OF SUGAR PINE TO THE FERTILE PLAINS OF CHICO THIS IS A GLORIOUS SAUNTER AND IMPOSES NO HARDSHIP (3000-15664-0041)
THE ASCENT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE IS AN EASY WALK AND THE VIEWS FROM THE SUMMIT ARE EXTREMELY TELLING (3000-15664-0042)
THE LOFTY ICY SHASTA TOWERING HIGH ABOVE ALL SEEMS BUT AN HOUR'S WALK FROM YOU THOUGH THE DISTANCE IN AN AIR LINE IS ABOUT SIXTY MILES (3000-15664-0043)
THE BIG MEADOWS LIE NEAR THE FOOT OF LASSEN'S BUTTE A BEAUTIFUL SPACIOUS BASIN SET IN THE HEART OF THE RICHLY FORESTED MOUNTAINS SCARCELY SURPASSED IN THE GRANDEUR OF ITS SURROUNDINGS BY TAHOE (3000-15664-0044)
THE GREAT WILDS OF OUR COUNTRY ONCE HELD TO BE BOUNDLESS AND INEXHAUSTIBLE ARE BEING RAPIDLY INVADED AND OVERRUN IN EVERY DIRECTION AND EVERYTHING DESTRUCTIBLE IN THEM IS BEING DESTROYED (3000-15664-0045)
EVERY LANDSCAPE LOW AND HIGH SEEMS DOOMED TO BE TRAMPLED AND HARRIED (3000-15664-0046)
SIR EDWARD NOT WHOLLY DISCOURAGED BY THE DENIAL WITH WHICH DORRIFORTH HAD WITH DELICACY ACQUAINTED HIM STILL HOPED FOR A KIND RECEPTION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MISSUS HORTON THAT LORD FREDERICK'S JEALOUSY WAS EXCITED AND THE TORTURES HE SUFFERED IN CONSEQUENCE CONVINCED HIM BEYOND A DOUBT OF THE SINCERITY OF HIS AFFECTION (3536-23268-0000)
EVERY TIME HE BEHELD THE OBJECT OF HIS PASSION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISITS THOUGH NOT SO FREQUENTLY AS HERETOFORE HE PLEADED HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH ARDOUR THAT MISS WOODLEY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMPASSIONATE COULD NOT RESIST WISHING HIM SUCCESS (3536-23268-0001)
YET DID THE WATCHFUL MISS WOODLEY OFTENTIMES HEAR A SIGH ESCAPE FROM HER UNKNOWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REMINDED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BLUSH WOULD INSTANTLY OVERSPREAD HER FACE (3536-23268-0002)
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY FEARS FOR HER WHEN ABROAD MORNING AFTER MORNING IT HAD BEEN BROKEN BY THE CLAMOUR OF HER RETURN (3536-23268-0003)
I HOPE MISS MILNER YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME (3536-23268-0004)
I THOUGHT MISS MILNER YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD THAT YOU WOULD PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME (3536-23268-0005)
YES INDEED AND I BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD KEEP MY FIRST PROMISE IS IT NOT (3536-23268-0006)
MISSUS HORTON ROSE FROM HER SEAT MOVED THE DECANTERS AND FRUIT ROUND THE TABLE STIRRED THE FIRE AND CAME BACK TO HER SEAT AGAIN BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS UTTERED (3536-23268-0007)
NOR HAD THIS GOOD WOMAN'S OFFICIOUS LABOURS TAKEN THE LEAST FROM THE AWKWARDNESS OF THE SILENCE WHICH AS SOON AS THE BUSTLE SHE HAD MADE WAS OVER RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE (3536-23268-0008)
MISS MILNER YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS EVENING SIR (3536-23268-0009)
AND HE WALKED IMMEDIATELY OUT OF THE APARTMENT BY ANOTHER DOOR (3536-23268-0010)
HER HAND FELL MOTIONLESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD SHE APPEARED MOTIONLESS HERSELF TILL MISSUS HORTON BESEECHING HER NOT TO BE UNEASY AT THE TREATMENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS FLOW AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAKING (3536-23268-0011)
IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GRIEF THAT SHE WEPT BUT THERE WAS A MAGNETIC QUALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATTRACTED HER'S (3536-23268-0012)
DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO ANSWERED MISS MILNER WITH AN EAGERNESS THAT FOR A TIME SUPPRESSED HER TEARS IN CONTRADICTION TO HIS WILL (3536-23268-0013)
IF YOU THINK SO MADAM I SEE NOTHING THAT SHOULD PREVENT ME NOW (3536-23268-0014)
NIECE I COMMAND YOU NOT TO STIR OUT OF THIS ROOM THIS EVENING (3536-23268-0015)
MISS WOODLEY OBEDIENTLY SAT DOWN AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CHAMBER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MARKED BY ONE IMPERTINENT WORD OR BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE RESTRAINT SHE SUFFERED (3536-23268-0016)
AT THE USUAL HOUR MISTER DORRIFORTH AND HIS WARD WERE SUMMONED TO TEA HE ENTERED WITH A COUNTENANCE WHICH EVINCED THE REMAINS OF ANGER HIS EYE GAVE TESTIMONY OF HIS ABSENT THOUGHTS AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PAMPHLET AFFECTING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISCERN THAT HE SCARCELY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND (3536-23268-0017)
MISS WOODLEY THOUGHT IT HER DUTY TO BE MUTE AND NOW THE GINGLE OF A TEA SPOON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONED BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET (3536-23268-0018)
MISSUS HORTON TOO IN THE SELF APPROVING REFLECTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUARREL OR ALTERCATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARKABLY PEACEFUL AND CHARITABLE (3536-23268-0019)
MISS WOODLEY DID NOT RECOLLECT HERSELF SO BUT WAS SO IN REALITY IN HER PEACE AND CHARITY WERE INSTINCTIVE VIRTUES ACCIDENT COULD NOT INCREASE THEM (3536-23268-0020)
HE COUGHED DRANK HIS TEA ENDEAVOURED TO TALK BUT FOUND IT DIFFICULT SOMETIMES READ AND IN THIS MANNER NEAR TWO HOURS WERE PASSED AWAY WHEN MISS MILNER CAME INTO THE ROOM NOT DRESSED FOR A BALL BUT AS SHE HAD RISEN FROM DINNER (3536-23268-0021)
DORRIFORTH READ ON AND SEEMED AFRAID OF LOOKING UP LEST HE SHOULD SEE WHAT HE COULD NOT HAVE PARDONED (3536-23268-0022)
AFTER A FEW MINUTES PAUSE AND SOME LITTLE EMBARRASSMENT ON THE PART OF MISSUS HORTON AT THE DISAPPOINTMENT SHE HAD TO ENCOUNTER FROM THIS UNEXPECTED DUTIFUL CONDUCT SHE ASKED MISS MILNER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TEA (3536-23268-0023)
DORRIFORTH THEN LAID THE BOOK OUT OF HIS HAND AND BY THE TIME THE SERVANT HAD LEFT THE ROOM THUS BEGAN (3536-23268-0024)
IT IS OFTEN THE UNGRATEFUL TASK OF A FRIEND TO BE TROUBLESOME SOMETIMES UNMANNERLY (3536-23268-0025)
FORGIVE THE DUTIES OF MY OFFICE AND BELIEVE THAT NO ONE IS HALF SO MUCH CONCERNED IF IT ROBS YOU OF ANY DEGREE OF HAPPINESS AS I MYSELF AM (3536-23268-0026)
WHAT HE SAID HE LOOKED WITH SO MUCH SINCERITY THAT HAD SHE BEEN BURNING WITH RAGE AT HIS LATE BEHAVIOUR SHE MUST HAVE FORGIVEN HIM FOR THE REGRET WHICH HE SO FORCIBLY EXPREST (3536-23268-0027)
SHE WAS GOING TO REPLY BUT FOUND SHE COULD NOT WITHOUT ACCOMPANYING HER WORDS WITH TEARS THEREFORE AFTER THE FIRST ATTEMPT SHE DESISTED (3536-23268-0028)

SANCHO REPLIED THAT ALL THE TREES WERE FULL OF MEN'S FEET AND LEGS (3576-138058-0013)
DON QUIXOTE WAS ON FOOT WITH HIS HORSE UNBRIDLED AND HIS LANCE LEANING AGAINST A TREE AND IN SHORT COMPLETELY DEFENCELESS HE THOUGHT IT BEST THEREFORE TO FOLD HIS ARMS AND BOW HIS HEAD AND RESERVE HIMSELF FOR A MORE FAVOURABLE OCCASION AND OPPORTUNITY (3576-138058-0014)

THE SERVANTS WEPT CLAUDIA SWOONED AWAY AGAIN AND AGAIN AND THE WHOLE PLACE SEEMED A FIELD OF SORROW AND AN ABODE OF MISFORTUNE (3576-138058-0027)
CLAUDIA TOLD HIM SHE MEANT TO GO TO A MONASTERY OF WHICH AN AUNT OF HERS WAS ABBESS WHERE SHE INTENDED TO PASS HER LIFE WITH A BETTER AND EVERLASTING SPOUSE (3576-138058-0028)
CLAUDIA WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT ALLOW HIM TO ACCOMPANY HER AND THANKING HIM FOR HIS OFFERS AS WELL AS SHE COULD TOOK LEAVE OF HIM IN TEARS (3576-138058-0029)
SANCHO SAID THEY HAD BUT THAT THREE KERCHIEFS THAT WERE WORTH THREE CITIES WERE MISSING (3576-138058-0030)
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MAN (3576-138058-0031)
SAID ONE OF THE BYSTANDERS I HAVE GOT THEM AND THEY ARE NOT WORTH THREE REALS (3576-138058-0032)
AT THIS INSTANT ONE OR TWO OF THOSE SQUIRES WHO WERE POSTED AS SENTINELS ON THE ROADS TO WATCH WHO CAME ALONG THEM AND REPORT WHAT PASSED TO THEIR CHIEF CAME UP AND SAID SENOR THERE IS A GREAT TROOP OF PEOPLE NOT FAR OFF COMING ALONG THE ROAD TO BARCELONA (3576-138058-0033)

AND NOW THE SQUIRES DESPATCHED TO MAKE THE PRIZE CAME UP BRINGING WITH THEM TWO GENTLEMEN ON HORSEBACK TWO PILGRIMS ON FOOT AND A COACH FULL OF WOMEN WITH SOME SIX SERVANTS ON FOOT AND ON HORSEBACK IN ATTENDANCE ON THEM AND A COUPLE OF MULETEERS WHOM THE GENTLEMEN HAD WITH THEM (3576-138058-0036)
THE CAPTAINS SHOWED PLAINLY THE CONCERN THEY FELT THE REGENT'S LADY WAS DOWNCAST AND THE PILGRIMS DID NOT AT ALL ENJOY SEEING THEIR PROPERTY CONFISCATED (3576-138058-0037)
THE REGENT'S LADY ORDERED ONE OF HER SERVANTS TO GIVE THE EIGHTY CROWNS THAT HAD BEEN ASSESSED AS HER SHARE AT ONCE FOR THE CAPTAINS HAD ALREADY PAID DOWN THEIR SIXTY (3576-138058-0038)
ONE OF THE SQUIRES OBSERVED IN HIS MIXTURE OF GASCON AND CATALAN THIS CAPTAIN OF OURS WOULD MAKE A BETTER FRIAR THAN HIGHWAYMAN IF HE WANTS TO BE SO GENEROUS ANOTHER TIME LET IT BE WITH HIS OWN PROPERTY AND NOT OURS (3576-138058-0039)
THEY WERE ALL TAKEN ABACK AND NOT ONE OF THEM DARED TO UTTER A WORD SUCH DEFERENCE DID THEY PAY HIM (3576-138058-0040)
CAPTAIN FRERE SAYS THAT THE SCENERY IS DELIGHTFUL (3752-4944-0000)
ABANDONED INDEED BY GOD AND MAN ALMOST (3752-4944-0001)
IN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF DEATH HE IS WITH US (3752-4944-0002)
YOU HAVE NOT BEEN LONG IN THE COLONY MISTER MEEKIN (3752-4944-0003)
IF YOU PLEASE SAID MEEKIN GRAVELY (3752-4944-0004)
PRAY HELP YOURSELF TO WINE (3752-4944-0005)
HAVE YOU MANY VISITORS CAPTAIN BURGESS VERY FEW (3752-4944-0006)
I WAS QUARTERED WITH HIM AT SARAH ISLAND (3752-4944-0007)
SO HE'S A FRIEND OF YOURS EH (3752-4944-0008)
I HAD THE PLEASURE OF MEETING HIM IN SOCIETY (3752-4944-0009)
HE IS JUST MARRIED YOU KNOW IS HE SAID BURGESS (3752-4944-0010)
THE DEVIL HE IS I HEARD SOMETHING ABOUT IT TOO (3752-4944-0011)
YES ONE OUGHTN'T TO LEAVE THE COLONY WITHOUT SEEING IT SAYS BURGESS IT'S WORTH SEEING (3752-4944-0012)
IN FACT THE RINGLEADER JOHN REX GAVE ME HIS CONFESSION AND I SENT IT TO THE BISHOP (3752-4944-0013)
A GREAT RASCAL PUT IN NORTH (3752-4944-0014)
WELL NOW SAID MEEKIN WITH ASPERITY I DON'T AGREE WITH YOU (3752-4944-0015)
HE SEEMS TO ME TO BE TRULY PENITENT FOR HIS OFFENCES A MISGUIDED BUT NOT A HYPOCRITICAL MAN IF MY KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE GOES FOR ANYTHING I HOPE HE IS SAID NORTH (3752-4944-0016)
THERE'S NO FEAR OF HIM SAID BURGESS CHEERILY IF HE GROWS UPROARIOUS WE'LL SOON GIVE HIM A TOUCH OF THE CAT (3752-4944-0017)
I SUPPOSE SEVERITY IS NECESSARY RETURNED MEEKIN THOUGH TO MY EARS A FLOGGING SOUNDS A LITTLE DISTASTEFUL (3752-4944-0018)
I HAVE THESE ATTACKS AT TIMES (3752-4944-0019)
THE REVEREND MEEKIN EYED HIS CLERICAL BROTHER WITH HORROR THE REVEREND MEEKIN WAS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO CLERGYMEN WHO WORE BLACK NECKTIES SMOKED CLAY PIPES CHEWED TOBACCO AND DRANK NEAT BRANDY OUT OF TUMBLERS (3752-4944-0020)
SO THEY WENT ON TO THE VERANDAH AND LOOKED DOWN UPON THE LIGHTS OF THE PRISON AND LISTENED TO THE SEA LAPPING THE SHORE (3752-4944-0021)
BY AND BY A SHORT FIGURE SMOKING A CHEROOT CAME UP OUT OF THE DARK AND PROVED TO BE DOCTOR MACKLEWAIN WHO HAD BEEN PREVENTED FROM ATTENDING THE DINNER BY REASON OF AN ACCIDENT TO A CONSTABLE AT NORFOLK BAY WHICH HAD CLAIMED HIS PROFESSIONAL ATTENTION (3752-4944-0022)
DEAD SAID DOCTOR MACKLEWAIN (3752-4944-0023)
DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU MISTER MEEKIN (3752-4944-0024)
BUT MACKLEWAIN WAS TIRED AND WANTED TO GET HOME (3752-4944-0025)
OUR ROADS LIE TOGETHER DOCTOR (3752-4944-0026)
BEFORE THE TWO CLERGYMEN HAD GOT HALF WAY DOWN THE STEEP PATH THAT LED FROM THE COMMANDANT'S HOUSE TO THE FLAT ON WHICH THE COTTAGES OF THE DOCTOR AND CHAPLAIN WERE BUILT MACKLEWAIN REJOINED THEM (3752-4944-0027)
ANOTHER FLOGGING TO MORROW SAID HE GRUMBLINGLY (3752-4944-0028)
WHOM IS HE GOING TO FLOG NOW (3752-4944-0029)
YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY HE'S GOING TO FLOG KIRKLAND (3752-4944-0030)
PERHAPS YOU'LL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO ALLOW ME TO BE THE BEST JUDGE OF THAT RETURNED MACKLEWAIN DRAWING UP HIS LITTLE BODY TO ITS LEAST INSIGNIFICANT STATURE (3752-4944-0031)
MISTER MEEKIN EXPRESSED SOME ALARM BUT DOCTOR MACKLEWAIN RE ASSURED HIM (3752-4944-0032)
WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING WITHOUT EVIDENCE COMPLAIN (3752-4944-0033)
I SHALL FIND MY PORTMANTEAU IN MY ROOM YOU SAID YES YES (3752-4944-0034)
HE SLEEPS AT THE BACK AND NORTH HURRIED OFF (3752-4944-0035)
AN IMPULSIVE GENTLEMAN SAID MEEKIN TO MACKLEWAIN AS THE SOUND OF MISTER NORTH'S FOOTSTEPS DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE (3752-4944-0036)
MACKLEWAIN SHOOK HIS HEAD SERIOUSLY (3752-4944-0037)
HE HAS THE STRANGEST FITS AT TIMES (3752-4944-0038)
UNLESS IT'S A CANCER IN THE STOMACH I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT CAN BE CANCER IN THE STOMACH (3752-4944-0039)
DOCTOR WE ALL HAVE OUR CROSSES HAVE WE NOT (3752-4944-0040)
HOW DELIGHTFUL THE GRASS SMELLS (3752-4944-0041)
GOOD NIGHT SIR I HOPE YOU WILL BE COMFORTABLE (3752-4944-0042)
I'LL TEACH MY PRISONERS TO ATTEMPT SUICIDE (3752-4944-0043)
THAT'S MACKLEWAIN'S BUSINESS (3752-4944-0044)
THEN DON'T YOU INTERFERE WITH ME SIR (3752-4944-0045)
I'VE GIVEN MY ORDERS SIR (3752-4944-0046)
THEN CAPTAIN BURGESS CRIED NORTH HIS PALE FACE FLUSHING I TELL YOU THE BOY'S BLOOD WILL BE ON YOUR HEAD (3752-4944-0047)
I AM A MINISTER OF GOD SIR AND I FORBID YOU TO COMMIT THIS CRIME (3752-4944-0048)
DAMN YOUR IMPERTINENCE SIR BURST OUT BURGESS (3752-4944-0049)
YOU'RE A DISMISSED OFFICER OF THE GOVERNMENT SIR (3752-4944-0050)
THIS OF COURSE WAS MERE BRAVADO ON THE PART OF THE COMMANDANT (3752-4944-0051)
NORTH KNEW WELL THAT HE WOULD NEVER DARE TO ATTEMPT ANY SUCH ACT OF VIOLENCE BUT THE INSULT STUNG HIM LIKE THE CUT OF A WHIP (3752-4944-0052)
SHOW MISTER NORTH OUT HE SAID AND GO DOWN TO THE BARRACKS AND TELL TROKE THAT KIRKLAND IS TO HAVE A HUNDRED LASHES TO MORROW (3752-4944-0053)
I'LL SHOW YOU WHO'S MASTER HERE MY GOOD SIR (3752-4944-0054)
THIS IS MURDEROUS (3752-4944-0055)
THE GOVERNMENT MAY GO TO AND YOU TOO ROARED BURGESS GET OUT (3752-4944-0056)
THEY SHALL NOT FLOG THAT BOY HE SAID (3752-4944-0057)
I'LL REPORT THIS TO THE GOVERNMENT (3752-4944-0058)
I WISH I HADN'T TAKEN THAT BRANDY HE SAID FOOL THAT I AM (3752-4944-0059)
OH GOD GIVE ME STRENGTH AID ME HELP ME (3752-4944-0060)
O LORD LOOK DOWN UPON ME (3752-4944-0061)
HE MIXED A TEASPOONFUL OF THIS IN A PANNIKIN OF WATER AND DRANK IT (3752-4944-0062)
IT RELIEVED HIM FOR A WHILE (3752-4944-0063)
IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD REACHED THE CRISIS OF A DISEASE WHICH HAD BEEN FOR DAYS GATHERING FORCE (3752-4944-0064)
I MUST HAVE A TEASPOONFUL HE SAID TO ALLAY THE CRAVING (3752-4944-0065)
TWICE HE PAUSED ON THE WAY TO THE SITTING ROOM AND TWICE WAS HE DRIVEN ON BY A POWER STRONGER THAN HIS WILL (3752-4944-0066)
HE SMELT THE NUTTY AROMA OF THE SPIRIT (3752-4944-0067)
THAT AT ALL TIMES DEBASING AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME IT WAS INFAMOUS THAT A VICE UNWORTHY OF ANY MAN WAS DOUBLY SINFUL IN A MAN OF EDUCATION AND A MINISTER OF GOD IN VAIN (3752-4944-0068)
IN THE MIDST OF HIS ARGUMENTS HE FOUND HIMSELF AT THE CUPBOARD WITH THE BOTTLE AT HIS LIPS IN AN ATTITUDE THAT WAS AT ONCE LUDICROUS AND HORRIBLE (3752-4944-0069)
CHAPTER THIRTY THREE A CONFIDANT (5338-24640-0000)
MISTER MORTON REPLIED THAT FAR FROM MAKING ANY CLAIM UPON HIS GOOD OPINION HIS ONLY WISH AND THE SOLE PURPOSE OF HIS VISIT WAS TO FIND OUT THE MEANS OF DESERVING IT (5338-24640-0001)
EVIL TO HIM THAT THINKS OTHERWISE SAID MISTER MORTON OR WHO HOLDS CHURCH GOVERNMENT AND CEREMONIES AS THE EXCLUSIVE GAGE OF CHRISTIAN FAITH OR MORAL VIRTUE (5338-24640-0002)
MISTER MORTON SEEMED PARTICULARLY STRUCK WITH THE ACCOUNT OF WAVERLEY'S VISIT TO DONALD BEAN LEAN (5338-24640-0003)
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN LIKE YOU MISTER WAVERLEY ANY SUCH HAIR BRAINED EXPEDITION I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR THE EXPRESSION WOULD HAVE HAD INEXPRESSIBLE CHARMS FOR ME (5338-24640-0004)
HE CERTAINLY POSSESSES TALENTS BEYOND THE RUDE SPHERE IN WHICH HE MOVES AND BEING NEITHER DESTITUTE OF AMBITION NOR ENCUMBERED WITH SCRUPLES HE WILL PROBABLY ATTEMPT BY EVERY MEANS TO DISTINGUISH HIMSELF DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE UNHAPPY COMMOTIONS (5338-24640-0005)
MISTER MORTON THEN MADE A CAREFUL MEMORANDUM OF THE VARIOUS PARTICULARS OF WAVERLEY'S INTERVIEW WITH DONALD BEAN LEAN AND THE OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH HE HAD COMMUNICATED (5338-24640-0006)
HE HAD NEITHER SYMPATHY WITH MY INNOCENCE NOR WITH MY WRETCHEDNESS AND THE PETRIFYING ACCURACY WITH WHICH HE ATTENDED TO EVERY FORM OF CIVILITY WHILE HE TORTURED ME BY HIS QUESTIONS HIS SUSPICIONS AND HIS INFERENCES WAS AS TORMENTING AS THE RACKS OF THE INQUISITION (5338-24640-0007)
THEY HELD CONVENTICLES IN THE OPEN FIELDS AND BEING TREATED WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND CRUELTY BY THE SCOTTISH GOVERNMENT MORE THAN ONCE TOOK ARMS DURING THOSE REIGNS (5338-24640-0008)
SINCE THAT TIME THEIR NUMBERS HAVE GRADUALLY DIMINISHED BUT A GOOD MANY ARE STILL TO BE FOUND IN THE WESTERN COUNTIES AND SEVERAL WITH A BETTER TEMPER THAN IN SEVENTEEN O SEVEN HAVE NOW TAKEN ARMS FOR GOVERNMENT (5338-24640-0009)
IT HAD NO ORNAMENTATION BEING EXCEEDINGLY PLAIN IN APPEARANCE (5338-284437-0000)
HERE SAID ONE OF THEIR GUIDES AS THE PROCESSION HALTED BEFORE THE LITTLE STONE BUILDING IS THE PALACE OF TOURMALINE WHO IS OUR QUEEN (5338-284437-0001)
WHAT THAT LITTLE CABIN (5338-284437-0002)
EXCLAIMED TROT OF COURSE (5338-284437-0003)
DID YOU SUPPOSE A PALACE WOULD BE LIKE ONE OF OUR HANDSOME RESIDENCES ASKED THE WOMAN EVIDENTLY SURPRISED (5338-284437-0004)
THESE INTRUDERS ARE VERY PECULIAR PEOPLE REMARKED A MAN IN THE CROWD (5338-284437-0005)
THEY SEEM VERY IGNORANT POOR THINGS SAID ANOTHER IN REPLY (5338-284437-0006)
THE PEOPLE MUST WAIT OUTSIDE FOR THERE IS NO ROOM FOR THEM IN THE PALACE (5338-284437-0007)
SO THEY FOLLOWED HER THROUGH THE LOW ARCHWAY AND IN A ROOM BEYOND VERY SIMPLY FURNISHED SAT A YOUNG GIRL ENGAGED IN DARNING A PAIR OF PINK STOCKINGS (5338-284437-0008)
SHE WAS A BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE NOT FAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE PINKIES BUT SLENDER AND WELL FORMED ACCORDING TO OUR OWN IDEAS OF BEAUTY (5338-284437-0009)
HER COMPLEXION WAS NOT A DECIDED PINK BUT A SOFT ROSY TINT NOT MUCH DEEPER THAN THAT OF TROT'S SKIN (5338-284437-0010)
WHAT IS IT CORALIE SHE ASKED THE WOMAN (5338-284437-0011)
THE QUEEN GAZED UPON OUR FRIENDS WITH EVIDENT INTEREST (5338-284437-0012)
SHE SMILED A LITTLE SADLY AT TROT SEEMED TO APPROVE BUTTON BRIGHT'S OPEN FRANK FACE AND WAS QUITE SURPRISED BECAUSE CAP'N BILL WAS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN PEOPLE (5338-284437-0013)
ARE YOU A GIANT (5338-284437-0014)
PERHAPS YOU ARE TRYING TO RIDICULE ME SHE CONTINUED REGARDING THE SAILOR'S FACE CLOSELY (5338-284437-0015)
THERE IS NOTHING MAJESTIC ABOUT ME AS YOU KNOW VERY WELL (5338-284437-0016)
CORALIE DO YOU CONSIDER MAJESTY A PROPER WORD TO USE WHEN ADDRESSING A QUEEN (5338-284437-0017)
EVEN IN AMERICA EVER'BODY BOWS LOW TO OUR PRESIDENT AN THE BLUESKINS ARE SO FRAID O THEIR BOOLOOROO THAT THEY TREMBLE WHENEVER THEY GO NEAR HIM (5338-284437-0018)
BUT SURELY THAT IS ALL WRONG SAID TOURMALINE GRAVELY (5338-284437-0019)
THEREFORE I AM A MERE AGENT TO DIRECT THE LAWS WHICH ARE THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND AM ONLY A PUBLIC SERVANT OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO GUARD THE WELFARE OF MY SUBJECTS (5338-284437-0020)
IN THAT CASE SAID BUTTON BRIGHT YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THE BEST THERE IS TO PAY FOR YOUR TROUBLE (5338-284437-0021)
IF I LIVED AS LUXURIOUSLY AS MY PEOPLE DO AND HAD SERVANTS AND COSTLY GOWNS THE GOOD PINKIES WOULD SAY THAT THEIR QUEEN HAD MORE THAN THEY THEMSELVES AND IT WOULD BE TRUE (5338-284437-0022)
NO OUR WAY IS BEST (5338-284437-0023)
THE QUEEN HAS NOTHING BUT THE POWER TO EXECUTE THE LAWS TO ADJUST GRIEVANCES AND TO COMPEL ORDER (5338-284437-0024)
I HAVE ONE GREAT PRIVILEGE (5338-284437-0025)
AFTER MY DEATH A PINK MARBLE STATUE OF ME WILL BE SET UP IN THE GRAND COURT WITH THE STATUES OF THE OTHER KINGS AND QUEENS WHO HAVE RULED THIS LAND AND ALL THE PINKIES IN AGES TO COME WILL THEN HONOR ME AS HAVING BEEN A JUST AND UPRIGHT QUEEN THAT IS MY REWARD (5338-284437-0026)
A MISFORTUNE OF BIRTH PLACED ME HERE AND I CANNOT ESCAPE MY FATE (5338-284437-0027)
IT IS MUCH MORE DESIRABLE TO BE A PRIVATE CITIZEN HAPPY AND CARE FREE (5338-284437-0028)
YES IT WAS WET AN STICKY ALL RIGHT AGREED THE SAILOR BUT THE BIG FROG HELPED US AN WE GOT THROUGH ALL RIGHT (5338-284437-0029)
YOU ARE NOT LIKE MY PEOPLE THE PINKIES AND THERE IS NO PLACE FOR YOU IN OUR COUNTRY (5338-284437-0030)
IN ALL OUR HISTORY YOU ARE THE FIRST PEOPLE FROM OUTSIDE OUR BORDERS WHO HAVE EVER STEPPED A FOOT IN OUR LAND (5338-284437-0031)
WE DO NOT HATE YOU AS YOU SAY THE BLUESKINS DO NOR ARE WE SAVAGE OR CRUEL BUT WE DO NOT WANT YOU HERE AND I AM REALLY PUZZLED WHAT TO DO WITH YOU (5338-284437-0032)
I'LL LOOK IN THE GREAT BOOK FIRST (5338-284437-0033)
ADVANCE INTO TENNESSEE (5694-64038-0000)
YANK SAYS WHAT YOU DOING JOHNNY (5694-64038-0001)
WE PASSED AROUND ATLANTA CROSSED THE CHATTAHOOCHEE AND TRAVELED BACK OVER THE SAME ROUTE ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE ARDUOUS CAMPAIGN UNDER JOE JOHNSTON (5694-64038-0002)
OUTSIDE OF THESE OCCASIONAL REMINDERS WE COULD SEE NO EVIDENCE OF THE DESOLATION OF THE TRACK OF AN INVADING ARMY (5694-64038-0003)
WE SAW THE UNITED STATES FLAG FLYING FROM THE RAMPARTS AND THOUGHT THAT YANK WOULD PROBABLY BE ASLEEP OR CATCHING LICE OR MAYBE ENGAGED IN A GAME OF SEVEN UP (5694-64038-0004)
HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HELLO BOYS WHAT IS IT BOSS (5694-64038-0005)
A YANKEE ALWAYS SAYS NAGER (5694-64038-0006)
THEY PERSUADED ELOQUENTLY (5694-64038-0007)
A MAN IN THE WELL (5694-64038-0008)
THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVERHEAD (5694-64038-0009)
RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DRY GRASS ALL BENDING TOWARD A COMMON CENTER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COMRADE HAD FALLEN IN IT (5694-64038-0010)
BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UNSOLVED PROBLEM (5694-64038-0011)
THE POOR FELLOW STAYED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT (5694-64038-0012)
WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE COAST WAS CLEAR (5694-64038-0013)
I DON'T THINK HIS GUN WAS LOADED THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE BALL WHISTLE (5694-64038-0014)
WE WALKED OVER THIS FLOATING BRIDGE AND SOON FOUND OURSELVES ON THE TENNESSEE SIDE OF TENNESSEE RIVER (5694-64038-0015)
WE HAD BEEF FOR SUPPER THAT NIGHT (5694-64038-0016)
HOW EVERY PULSE DID BEAT AND LEAP AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THROB WITH EMOTIONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY AKIN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELLIGENCE OF OUR ONWARD MARCH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROMISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONES (5694-64038-0017)
WE WERE INURED TO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MARCH IN EVERY BATTLE IN EVERY SKIRMISH IN EVERY ADVANCE IN EVERY RETREAT IN EVERY VICTORY IN EVERY DEFEAT (5694-64038-0018)
HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BYE AND TO GET HIS CLOTHES IT WAS NO GO (5694-64038-0019)
BUT AFTER AWHILE JIM SAYS GENTLEMEN AY GANNY THE LAW (5694-64038-0020)
YOU SEE JIM KNOWED THE LAW (5694-64038-0021)
THOSE OLD SOLDIERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOTTEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT JIM HAD TREASURED IT UP IN HIS MEMORY LO THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERVE HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FREQUENTLY DONE IN THE PAST (5694-64038-0022)
THE THIRD DAY IT WAS REPORTED THAT THE YANKEES HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MURFREESBORO PIKE (5694-64038-0023)
A REGIMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATTACK IT WAS JIM'S REGIMENT (5694-64038-0024)
HE HADN'T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHOOT AT BUT HE BLAZED AWAY HE LOADED AND FIRED THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDERED TO RETREAT (5694-64038-0025)
BUT IS LAUGHTER A SYNONYM OF JOY (5895-34615-0000)
SUCH PERFECT COMPLETENESS IS NOT IN NATURE (5895-34615-0001)
HAD GWYNPLAINE WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTHY OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECTED TO TRANSMUTATION WHY NOT (5895-34615-0002)
ACCORDING TO ALL APPEARANCE INDUSTRIOUS MANIPULATORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE (5895-34615-0003)
IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT A MYSTERIOUS AND PROBABLY OCCULT SCIENCE WHICH WAS TO SURGERY WHAT ALCHEMY WAS TO CHEMISTRY HAD CHISELLED HIS FLESH EVIDENTLY AT A VERY TENDER AGE AND MANUFACTURED HIS COUNTENANCE WITH PREMEDITATION (5895-34615-0004)
GWYNPLAINE WAS A MOUNTEBANK (5895-34615-0005)
HE SHOWED HIMSELF ON THE PLATFORM (5895-34615-0006)
IT WAS GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WHICH CREATED THE LAUGHTER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF (5895-34615-0007)
THE OUTSIDE DID NOT DEPEND ON THE INTERIOR (5895-34615-0008)
NO ONE COULD ESCAPE FROM THIS RICTUS (5895-34615-0009)
ALL HIS EMOTIONS WHATEVER THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN AUGMENTED HIS STRANGE FACE OF JOY OR TO SPEAK MORE CORRECTLY AGGRAVATED IT (5895-34615-0010)
AN EVERLASTING LAUGH (5895-34615-0011)
THE MANICHAEANS BELIEVED THE ABSOLUTE OCCASIONALLY GIVES WAY AND THAT GOD HIMSELF SOMETIMES ABDICATES FOR A TIME SO ALSO OF THE WILL (5895-34615-0012)
THE WHOLE OF EXISTENCE RESEMBLES A LETTER MODIFIED IN THE POSTSCRIPT (5895-34615-0013)
WITH THIS EXCEPTION GWYNPLAINE'S LAUGH WAS EVERLASTING (5895-34615-0014)
THE JOYOUS CONVULSION OF LAUGHTER WAS AS A TRIBUTE PAID THEY SUBMITTED TO IT GLADLY BUT ALMOST MECHANICALLY (5895-34615-0015)
BESIDES WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THEY HAD IN THOSE TIMES MEANS OF PUTTING PATIENTS TO SLEEP AND OF SUPPRESSING ALL SUFFERING ONLY THEN IT WAS CALLED MAGIC WHILE NOW IT IS CALLED ANAESTHESIA (5895-34615-0016)
BESIDES THIS FACE THOSE WHO HAD BROUGHT HIM UP HAD GIVEN HIM THE RESOURCES OF A GYMNAST AND AN ATHLETE (5895-34615-0017)
GWYNPLAINE HAD YELLOW HAIR (5895-34615-0018)
HIS HAIR HAVING PROBABLY BEEN DYED WITH SOME CORROSIVE PREPARATION HAD LEFT IT WOOLLY AND ROUGH TO THE TOUCH (5895-34615-0019)
ITS YELLOW BRISTLES RATHER A MANE THAN A HEAD OF HAIR COVERED AND CONCEALED A LOFTY BROW EVIDENTLY MADE TO CONTAIN THOUGHT (5895-34615-0020)
THE OPERATION WHATEVER IT HAD BEEN WHICH HAD DEPRIVED HIS FEATURES OF HARMONY AND PUT ALL THEIR FLESH INTO DISORDER HAD HAD NO EFFECT ON THE BONY STRUCTURE OF HIS HEAD (5895-34615-0021)
WHAT TRUE THINGS ARE TOLD IN STORIES (5895-34622-0000)
IN GWYNPLAINE EVIL THOUGHTS NEVER RIPENED AND HE HAD THEREFORE NO REMORSE (5895-34622-0001)
WHAT WAS THIS NOTHING (5895-34622-0002)
FROM SIXTEEN EIGHTY TO SEVENTEEN O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE (5895-34622-0003)
THE WHEELS WERE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE AND HIGH AS WAGON WHEELS (5895-34622-0004)
THIS GREEN COLOUR HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE CARRIAGE WHICH WAS KNOWN IN ALL THE FAIR GROUNDS AS THE GREEN BOX (5895-34622-0005)
ON THE ROOF FROM A TUBE PAINTED GREEN LIKE THE REST SMOKE AROSE (5895-34622-0006)
THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH THE VILLAGERS REGARDED THIS MACHINE WAS OVERWHELMING (5895-34622-0007)
THIS WAS THE OLD ESTABLISHMENT OF URSUS ITS PROPORTIONS AUGMENTED BY SUCCESS AND IMPROVED FROM A WRETCHED BOOTH INTO A THEATRE (5895-34622-0008)
UNKNOWN PEOPLE HAD WORKED UPON HIS FACE HE ON THE OTHER HAND HAD WORKED ON HIS MIND AND BEHIND THIS WELL EXECUTED MASK HE HAD PLACED ALL THAT HE COULD OF THOUGHT (5895-34622-0009)
THE EFFECT OF HIS APPEARANCE HAD BEEN SURPRISING (5895-34622-0010)
SOME BELIEVED IT TO BE NATURAL OTHERS DECLARED IT TO BE ARTIFICIAL AND AS CONJECTURE WAS ADDED TO REALITY EVERYWHERE AT EVERY CROSS ROAD ON THE JOURNEY IN ALL THE GROUNDS OF FAIRS AND FETES THE CROWD RAN AFTER GWYNPLAINE (5895-34622-0011)
THE CURIOSITY OF ONE PLACE EXHAUSTED THEY PASSED ON TO ANOTHER (5895-34622-0012)
THIS FORTUNE HAD ALLOWED URSUS WHO WAS THE ADMINISTRATOR OF GWYNPLAINE'S SUCCESS TO HAVE THE CHARIOT OF HIS DREAMS CONSTRUCTED THAT IS TO SAY A CARAVAN LARGE ENOUGH TO CARRY A THEATRE AND TO SOW SCIENCE AND ART IN THE HIGHWAYS (5895-34622-0013)
FOR THESE READ FIBI AND VINOS THAT WE MAY CONFORM TO ENGLISH PRONUNCIATION (5895-34622-0014)

WITH THE INSIGHT OF A KINDRED TEMPERAMENT HE PRONOUNCED HIS VERDICT (777-126732-0044)
THERE ARE NATURES TOO TO WHOSE SENSE OF JUSTICE THE PRICE EXACTED LOOMS UP MONSTROUSLY ENORMOUS ODIOUS OPPRESSIVE WORRYING HUMILIATING EXTORTIONATE INTOLERABLE THOSE ARE THE FANATICS (777-126732-0045)
IN ANY CASE HE HAD NOT THE TIME (777-126732-0046)
LOAFING WAS ALL VERY WELL FOR THESE FELLOWS WHO KNEW NOT MISTER VLADIMIR AND HAD WOMEN TO FALL BACK UPON WHEREAS HE HAD A WOMAN TO PROVIDE FOR (777-126732-0047)
THESE WERE BUT FEW AND FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HE OPENED HIS SHOP HE TOOK A COMMERCIAL SURVEY OF ITS VALUE (777-126732-0048)
THIS SURVEY WAS UNFAVOURABLE (777-126732-0049)
HE TOOK THE CASH BOX OUT OF THE DRAWER AND TURNING TO LEAVE THE SHOP BECAME AWARE THAT STEVIE WAS STILL DOWNSTAIRS (777-126732-0050)
HE LOOKED DUBIOUSLY AT HIS BROTHER IN LAW BUT HE DID NOT ASK HIM FOR INFORMATION (777-126732-0051)
MISTER VERLOC PERCEIVED WITH SOME SURPRISE THAT HE DID NOT KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY TO STEVIE (777-126732-0052)
HE STOOD STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PARLOUR AND LOOKED INTO THE KITCHEN IN SILENCE (777-126732-0053)
HE WATCHED HIM GESTICULATING AND MURMURING IN THE KITCHEN (777-126732-0054)
STEVIE PROWLED ROUND THE TABLE LIKE AN EXCITED ANIMAL IN A CAGE (777-126732-0055)
THE LIGHT THROWN DOWN BY THE SHADE FELL DAZZLINGLY ON THE WHITE PILLOW SUNK BY THE WEIGHT OF HER HEAD REPOSING WITH CLOSED EYES AND DARK HAIR DONE UP IN SEVERAL PLAITS FOR THE NIGHT (777-126732-0056)
HER BARE FEET AS IF POKED THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF AN UNADORNED SLEEVED CALICO SACK BUTTONED TIGHTLY AT NECK AND WRISTS FELT OVER THE RUG FOR THE SLIPPERS WHILE SHE LOOKED UPWARD INTO HER HUSBAND'S FACE (777-126732-0057)
THERE IS NO OCCUPATION THAT FAILS A MAN MORE COMPLETELY THAN THAT OF A SECRET AGENT OF POLICE (777-126732-0058)
IT'S LIKE YOUR HORSE SUDDENLY FALLING DEAD UNDER YOU IN THE MIDST OF AN UNINHABITED AND THIRSTY PLAIN (777-126732-0059)
THE COMPARISON OCCURRED TO MISTER VERLOC BECAUSE HE HAD SAT ASTRIDE VARIOUS ARMY HORSES IN HIS TIME AND HAD NOW THE SENSATION OF AN INCIPIENT FALL (777-126732-0060)
THE PROSPECT WAS AS BLACK AS THE WINDOW PANE AGAINST WHICH HE WAS LEANING HIS FOREHEAD (777-126732-0061)
YES NOT AT ALL WELL (777-126732-0062)
DOWN BELOW IN THE QUIET NARROW STREET MEASURED FOOTSTEPS APPROACHED THE HOUSE THEN DIED AWAY UNHURRIED AND FIRM AS IF THE PASSER BY HAD STARTED TO PACE OUT ALL ETERNITY FROM GAS LAMP TO GAS LAMP IN A NIGHT WITHOUT END AND THE DROWSY TICKING OF THE OLD CLOCK ON THE LANDING BECAME DISTINCTLY AUDIBLE IN THE BEDROOM (777-126732-0063)
THAT POOR BOY IS IN A VERY EXCITED STATE TO NIGHT SHE MURMURED AFTER A PAUSE WHICH LASTED FOR THREE TICKS OF THE CLOCK (777-126732-0064)
THIS DREAD LED HIM TO MAKE THE REMARK THAT STEVIE HAD DISREGARDED HIS SUGGESTION TO GO TO BED (777-126732-0065)
THERE WAS NO YOUNG MAN OF HIS AGE IN LONDON MORE WILLING AND DOCILE THAN STEPHEN SHE AFFIRMED NONE MORE AFFECTIONATE AND READY TO PLEASE AND EVEN USEFUL AS LONG AS PEOPLE DID NOT UPSET HIS POOR HEAD (777-126732-0066)
MISTER VERLOC'S ANXIETIES HAD PREVENTED HIM FROM ATTACHING ANY SENSE TO WHAT HIS WIFE WAS SAYING (777-126732-0067)
THAT BOY HEARS TOO MUCH OF WHAT IS TALKED ABOUT HERE (777-126732-0068)
IF I HAD KNOWN THEY WERE COMING TO NIGHT I WOULD HAVE SEEN TO IT THAT HE WENT TO BED AT THE SAME TIME I DID (777-126732-0069)
HE WAS OUT OF HIS MIND WITH SOMETHING HE OVERHEARD ABOUT EATING PEOPLE'S FLESH AND DRINKING BLOOD WHAT'S THE GOOD OF TALKING LIKE THAT (777-126732-0070)
MISTER VERLOC WAS FULLY RESPONSIVE NOW (777-126732-0071)
ASK KARL YUNDT HE GROWLED SAVAGELY (777-126732-0072)
HE ISN'T FIT TO HEAR WHAT'S SAID HERE HE BELIEVES IT'S ALL TRUE (777-126732-0073)
HE KNOWS NO BETTER HE GETS INTO HIS PASSIONS OVER IT (777-126732-0074)
HE GLARED AT ME AS IF HE DIDN'T KNOW WHO I WAS WHEN I WENT DOWNSTAIRS (777-126732-0075)
I WISH HE HAD NEVER BEEN TO SCHOOL MISSUS VERLOC BEGAN AGAIN BRUSQUELY (777-126732-0076)
HE GETS A RED FACE PORING OVER THEM (777-126732-0077)
I WOULDN'T GIVE A HALFPENNY FOR THE WHOLE LOT (777-126732-0078)
THE OTHER DAY STEVIE GOT HOLD OF ONE AND THERE WAS A STORY IN IT OF A GERMAN SOLDIER OFFICER TEARING HALF OFF THE EAR OF A RECRUIT AND NOTHING WAS DONE TO HIM FOR IT THE BRUTE (777-126732-0079)
HE CAN'T STAND THE NOTION OF ANY CRUELTY (777-126732-0080)
COMFORTABLE DEAR (777-126732-0081)
SOME ARE WONDERFULLY WROUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOMES FOR BIRDIKINS (7850-281318-0000)
INDEED IT IS NOT A NEST AT ALL ONLY THE BEGINNING OF ONE (7850-281318-0001)
AND THERE IS AN OLD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU (7850-281318-0002)
OH WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME (7850-281318-0003)
AND THE POOR SILLY THINGS RUFFLED UP THEIR FEATHERS AND LOOKED MISERABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UNHAPPY (7850-281318-0004)
SHE WAS INDEED A CLEVER BIRD (7850-281318-0005)
SHE POPPED INTO HER NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORTABLY PEERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SLITS WITH HER SHARP LITTLE EYES (7850-281318-0006)
AND SHE SAW THE OTHER BIRDS HOPPING ABOUT AND TWITTERING HELPLESSLY (7850-281318-0007)
THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRDS CHIRPED EAGERLY YES YES LET US ASK HER TO TEACH US (7850-281318-0008)
SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FLUTTERING HOPPING TWITTERING UP TO THE ELM TREE WHERE MOTHER MAGPIE NESTLED COMFORTABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE (7850-281318-0009)
O WISE MOTHER MAGPIE DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE THEY CRIED TEACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NESTS LIKE YOURS FOR IT IS GROWING NIGHT AND WE ARE TIRED AND SLEEPY (7850-281318-0010)
THE MAGPIE SAID SHE WOULD TEACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A PATIENT DILIGENT OBEDIENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRDS (7850-281318-0011)
AND WHERE EACH BIRD PERCHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NEST (7850-281318-0012)
SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WEAVE THE BITS OF THINGS TOGETHER INTO NESTS AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE (7850-281318-0013)
AND SOME OF THE BIRDS WHO WERE ATTENTIVE AND CAREFUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND STARTED NICE HOMES FOR THEMSELVES (7850-281318-0014)
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN (7850-281318-0015)
CERTAINLY OF COURSE SCREAMED THE JACKDAW (7850-281318-0016)
HERE WOOD PIGEON SAID MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MUST PLACE THOSE STICKS THROUGH AND ACROSS CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO (7850-281318-0017)
CRISS CROSS CRISS CROSS SO INTERRUPTED THE WOOD PIGEON (7850-281318-0018)
YOU SAY YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO ON AND FINISH YOUR NESTS BY YOURSELVES (7850-281318-0019)
MUCH LUCK MAY YOU HAVE (7850-281318-0020)
AND AWAY SHE FLEW TO HER OWN COSY NEST IN THE ELM TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON FAST ASLEEP FORGETTING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER (7850-281318-0021)
BUT THE WOOD PIGEON WAS IN THE WORST CASE OF THEM ALL (7850-281318-0022)
FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUNDATION LAID CRISS CROSS AS THE MAGPIE HAD SHOWN HER (7850-281318-0023)
A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHBORS WOULD BE FOND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO (7850-286674-0000)
IT IS DISGRACEFUL (7850-286674-0001)
THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRINGING UP OR NO BRINGING UP AT ALL (7850-286674-0002)
THEY ALWAYS ATE PLAIN FOOD AND PLENTY OF IT AND THEY NEVER ATE BETWEEN MEALS (7850-286674-0003)
YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEGS APIECE AND THREE JOINTS IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID (7850-286674-0004)
THEY DID NOT BREATHE IT INTO THEIR MOUTHS OR THROUGH GILLS BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPENINGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BODIES (7850-286674-0005)
BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LARVAE (7850-286674-0006)
WELL OUR LOWER LIPS ANYWAY ANSWERED THE NYMPH (7850-286674-0007)
OUR UPPER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON'T MATTER (7850-286674-0008)
THEY KNEW THAT WHENEVER THEY STUCK OUT THEIR LOWER LIPS AT THE SMALL FISHES AND BUGS THEY SWAM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD (7850-286674-0009)
INDEED THE LOWER LIP OF A DRAGON FLY CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHTEN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FASTENED ON A LONG JOINTED ARM LIKE THING AND HAS PINCERS ON IT WITH WHICH IT CATCHES AND HOLDS ITS FOOD (7850-286674-0010)
BUT SOMETIMES HE STRAIGHTENS THE JOINT AND HOLDS HIS LIP OUT BEFORE HIM AND THEN ITS PINCERS CATCH HOLD OF THINGS HE DOES THIS WHEN HE IS HUNGRY (7850-286674-0011)
SCARED DAH WHO'S AFRAID ANSWERED HE (7850-286674-0012)
HERE COMES THE SNAPPING TURTLE (7850-286674-0013)
SURE ENOUGH THERE HE CAME THROUGH THE SHALLOW WATER HIS WET BACK SHELL PARTLY OUT OF IT AND SHINING IN THE SUNLIGHT (7850-286674-0014)
THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A NAP AFTER HIS DINNER (7850-286674-0015)
HE BEGAN TO DRAW IN HIS LEGS VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOWER SHELL TOUCHED THE MUD THE LAST LARVA CRAWLED OUT UNDER HIS TAIL (7850-286674-0016)
THE NYMPHS HAD ALREADY GOTTEN AWAY (7850-286674-0017)
HE HAD LITTLE ENOUGH TO BREAK OR BITE AND ONCE WHEN THERE WAS A GREAT FAMINE IN THE LAND HE COULD HARDLY PROCURE EVEN HIS DAILY BREAD AND AS HE LAY THINKING IN HIS BED ONE NIGHT HE SIGHED AND SAID TO HIS WIFE WHAT WILL BECOME OF US (7976-110523-0000)
HOW CAN WE FEED OUR CHILDREN WHEN WE HAVE NO MORE THAN WE CAN EAT OURSELVES (7976-110523-0001)
OH YOU SIMPLETON SAID SHE THEN WE MUST ALL FOUR DIE OF HUNGER YOU HAD BETTER PLANE THE COFFINS FOR US (7976-110523-0002)
BUT SHE LEFT HIM NO PEACE TILL HE CONSENTED SAYING AH BUT I SHALL MISS THE POOR CHILDREN (7976-110523-0003)
AND AS SOON AS THEIR PARENTS HAD GONE TO SLEEP HE GOT UP PUT ON HIS COAT AND UNBARRING THE BACK DOOR WENT OUT (7976-110523-0004)
AH FATHER SAID HANSEL I AM LOOKING AT MY WHITE CAT SITTING UPON THE ROOF OF THE HOUSE AND TRYING TO SAY GOOD BYE (7976-110523-0005)
BUT IN REALITY HANSEL WAS NOT LOOKING AT A CAT BUT EVERY TIME HE STOPPED HE DROPPED A PEBBLE OUT OF HIS POCKET UPON THE PATH (7976-110523-0006)
BUT HER HUSBAND FELT HEAVY AT HEART AND THOUGHT IT WERE BETTER TO SHARE THE LAST CRUST WITH THE CHILDREN (7976-110523-0007)
EARLY IN THE MORNING THE STEPMOTHER CAME AND PULLED THEM OUT OF BED AND GAVE THEM EACH A SLICE OF BREAD WHICH WAS STILL SMALLER THAN THE FORMER PIECE (7976-110523-0008)
WE ARE GOING INTO THE FOREST TO HEW WOOD AND IN THE EVENING WHEN WE ARE READY WE WILL COME AND FETCH YOU AGAIN (7976-110523-0009)
HANSEL THOUGHT THE ROOF TASTED VERY NICE AND SO HE TORE OFF A GREAT PIECE WHILE GRETHEL BROKE A LARGE ROUND PANE OUT OF THE WINDOW AND SAT DOWN QUITE CONTENTEDLY (7976-110523-0010)
COME IN AND STOP WITH ME AND NO HARM SHALL COME TO YOU AND SO SAYING SHE TOOK THEM BOTH BY THE HAND AND LED THEM INTO HER COTTAGE (7976-110523-0011)
THE OLD WOMAN BEHAVED VERY KINDLY TO THEM BUT IN REALITY SHE WAS A WICKED OLD WITCH WHO WAY LAID CHILDREN AND BUILT THE BREADHOUSE IN ORDER TO ENTICE THEM IN BUT AS SOON AS THEY WERE IN HER POWER SHE KILLED THEM COOKED AND ATE THEM AND MADE A GREAT FESTIVAL OF THE DAY (7976-110523-0012)
THEN SHE TOOK UP HANSEL WITH HER ROUGH HAND AND SHUT HIM UP IN A LITTLE CAGE WITH A LATTICE DOOR AND ALTHOUGH HE SCREAMED LOUDLY IT WAS OF NO USE (7976-110523-0013)
GRETHEL BEGAN TO CRY BUT IT WAS ALL USELESS FOR THE OLD WITCH MADE HER DO AS SHE WANTED (7976-110523-0014)
GRETHEL SHE CRIED IN A PASSION GET SOME WATER QUICKLY BE HANSEL FAT OR LEAN THIS MORNING I WILL KILL AND COOK HIM (7976-110523-0015)
DEAR GOOD GOD HELP US NOW SHE PRAYED (7976-110523-0016)
CREEP IN SAID THE WITCH AND SEE IF IT IS HOT ENOUGH AND THEN WE WILL PUT IN THE BREAD BUT SHE INTENDED WHEN GRETHEL GOT IN TO SHUT UP THE OVEN AND LET HER BAKE SO THAT SHE MIGHT EAT HER AS WELL AS HANSEL (7976-110523-0017)
SEE I COULD EVEN GET IN MYSELF (7976-110523-0018)
AND SHE GOT UP AND PUT HER HEAD INTO THE OVEN (7976-110523-0019)
AND NOW AS THERE WAS NOTHING TO FEAR THEY WENT BACK TO THE WITCH'S HOUSE WHERE IN EVERY CORNER WERE CASKETS FULL OF PEARLS AND PRECIOUS STONES (7976-110523-0020)
THEN THEY BEGAN TO RUN AND RUSHING INTO THE HOUSE THEY FELL UPON THEIR FATHER'S NECK (7976-110523-0021)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE HE ASKED (8297-275156-0000)
YOU HAVE BEEN TO THE HOTEL HE BURST OUT YOU HAVE SEEN CATHERINE (8297-275156-0001)
WE HAVE BOTH SEEN THE SAME NEWSPAPER OF COURSE AND YOU HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO CLEAR THE THING UP THAT'S IT ISN'T IT (8297-275156-0002)
NOT SATISFIED WITH GOSSIP IN PRIVATE THE GREEDY PUBLIC APPETITE DEVOURS GOSSIP IN PRINT AND WANTS MORE OF IT THAN ANY ONE EDITOR CAN SUPPLY (8297-275156-0003)
SUPPOSING THE REPORT HAD BEEN TRUE (8297-275156-0004)
IN THE MEANTIME AFTER WHAT MISSUS PRESTY HAD CONFESSED THE CRUEL FALSEHOOD WHICH HAD CHECKED POOR KITTY'S NATURAL INQUIRIES RAISED AN INSUPERABLE OBSTACLE TO A MEETING BETWEEN FATHER AND CHILD (8297-275156-0005)
HE HAD PROMISED TO DO HIS BEST TOWARD PERSUADING CATHERINE TO GRANT SYDNEY AN INTERVIEW (8297-275156-0006)
EVEN THE CHANCE OF SUCCESSFULLY CONFIDING HER TO BENNYDECK'S PROTECTION HAD LOST SOMETHING OF ITS FAIR PROMISE SINCE RANDAL'S VISIT TO SYDENHAM (8297-275156-0007)
BE THE RESULTS HOWEVER WHAT THEY MIGHT RANDAL COULD SEE BUT ONE PLAIN COURSE BEFORE HIM NOW (8297-275156-0008)
CONSIDERATIONS OF DELICACY SEEMED TO FORBID TAKING THIS LIBERTY EVEN WITH AN INTIMATE FRIEND (8297-275156-0009)
WHAT HAPPIER FUTURE COULD AWAIT HER ESPECIALLY IF SHE JUSTIFIED RANDAL'S PAST EXPERIENCE OF ALL THAT WAS CANDID AND TRUTHFUL IN HER CHARACTER THAN TO BECOME HIS FRIEND'S WIFE (8297-275156-0010)
SHALL I SAY THAT SHE MAY EXPECT AN EARLY VISIT FROM YOU WHEN I SEE HER TO MORROW (8297-275156-0011)
HE ADDED SYDNEY'S ADDRESS IN A POSTSCRIPT AND DISPATCHED HIS LETTER THAT EVENING (8297-275156-0012)
BUT IT MIGHT PERHAPS BE EXCUSABLE TO INFER THAT THE MARRIAGE HAD NOT YET BEEN DECIDED ON AND THAT THE CAPTAIN'S PROPOSALS WERE STILL WAITING FOR CATHERINE'S REPLY (8297-275156-0013)
BUT WITH FULL RAVISHMENT THE HOURS OF PRIME SINGING RECEIVED THEY IN THE MIDST OF LEAVES THAT EVER BORE A BURDEN TO THEIR RHYMES (84-121550-0000)
ALL WATERS THAT ON EARTH MOST LIMPID ARE WOULD SEEM TO HAVE WITHIN THEMSELVES SOME MIXTURE COMPARED WITH THAT WHICH NOTHING DOTH CONCEAL (84-121550-0001)
THOU MAKEST ME REMEMBER WHERE AND WHAT PROSERPINA THAT MOMENT WAS WHEN LOST HER MOTHER HER AND SHE HERSELF THE SPRING (84-121550-0002)
I DO NOT THINK THERE SHONE SO GREAT A LIGHT UNDER THE LIDS OF VENUS WHEN TRANSFIXED BY HER OWN SON BEYOND HIS USUAL CUSTOM (84-121550-0003)
YE ARE NEW COMERS AND BECAUSE I SMILE BEGAN SHE PERADVENTURE IN THIS PLACE ELECT TO HUMAN NATURE FOR ITS NEST (84-121550-0004)
SOME APPREHENSION KEEPS YOU MARVELLING BUT THE PSALM DELECTASTI GIVETH LIGHT WHICH HAS THE POWER TO UNCLOUD YOUR INTELLECT (84-121550-0005)
THE GOOD SUPREME SOLE IN ITSELF DELIGHTING CREATED MAN GOOD AND THIS GOODLY PLACE GAVE HIM AS HANSEL OF ETERNAL PEACE (84-121550-0006)
BY HIS DEFAULT SHORT WHILE HE SOJOURNED HERE BY HIS DEFAULT TO WEEPING AND TO TOIL HE CHANGED HIS INNOCENT LAUGHTER AND SWEET PLAY (84-121550-0007)
THIS EVERY OTHER SAVOUR DOTH TRANSCEND AND NOTWITHSTANDING SLAKED SO FAR MAY BE THY THIRST THAT I REVEAL TO THEE NO MORE (84-121550-0008)
BETWEEN HER STEPS AND MINE WERE NOT A HUNDRED WHEN EQUALLY THE MARGINS GAVE A TURN IN SUCH A WAY THAT TO THE EAST I FACED (84-121550-0009)
NOR EVEN THUS OUR WAY CONTINUED FAR BEFORE THE LADY WHOLLY TURNED HERSELF UNTO ME SAYING BROTHER LOOK AND LISTEN (84-121550-0010)
NOW HELICON MUST NEEDS POUR FORTH FOR ME AND WITH HER CHOIR URANIA MUST ASSIST ME TO PUT IN VERSE THINGS DIFFICULT TO THINK (84-121550-0011)
THEN BACK I TURNED MY FACE TO THOSE HIGH THINGS WHICH MOVED THEMSELVES TOWARDS US SO SEDATELY THEY HAD BEEN DISTANCED BY NEW WEDDED BRIDES (84-121550-0012)
AND I BEHELD THE FLAMELETS ONWARD GO LEAVING BEHIND THEMSELVES THE AIR DEPICTED AND THEY OF TRAILING PENNONS HAD THE SEMBLANCE SO THAT IT OVERHEAD REMAINED DISTINCT WITH SEVENFOLD LISTS ALL OF THEM OF THE COLOURS WHENCE THE SUN'S BOW IS MADE AND DELIA'S GIRDLE (84-121550-0013)
THESE STANDARDS TO THE REARWARD LONGER WERE THAN WAS MY SIGHT AND AS IT SEEMED TO ME TEN PACES WERE THE OUTERMOST APART (84-121550-0014)
THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THESE FOUR CONTAINED A CHARIOT TRIUMPHAL ON TWO WHEELS WHICH BY A GRIFFIN'S NECK CAME DRAWN ALONG (84-121550-0015)
NOT ONLY ROME WITH NO SUCH SPLENDID CAR E'ER GLADDENED AFRICANUS OR AUGUSTUS BUT POOR TO IT THAT OF THE SUN WOULD BE (84-121550-0016)
THREE MAIDENS AT THE RIGHT WHEEL IN A CIRCLE CAME ONWARD DANCING ONE SO VERY RED THAT IN THE FIRE SHE HARDLY HAD BEEN NOTED (84-121550-0017)
THE SECOND WAS AS IF HER FLESH AND BONES HAD ALL BEEN FASHIONED OUT OF EMERALD THE THIRD APPEARED AS SNOW BUT NEWLY FALLEN (84-121550-0018)
IN REAR OF ALL THE GROUP HERE TREATED OF TWO OLD MEN I BEHELD UNLIKE IN HABIT BUT LIKE IN GAIT EACH DIGNIFIED AND GRAVE (84-121550-0019)
AND WHEN THE CAR WAS OPPOSITE TO ME THUNDER WAS HEARD AND ALL THAT FOLK AUGUST SEEMED TO HAVE FURTHER PROGRESS INTERDICTED (84-121550-0020)
AND ONE OF THEM AS IF BY HEAVEN COMMISSIONED SINGING VENI SPONSA DE LIBANO SHOUTED THREE TIMES AND ALL THE OTHERS AFTER (84-121550-0021)
AS SOON AS ON MY VISION SMOTE THE POWER SUBLIME THAT HAD ALREADY PIERCED ME THROUGH ERE FROM MY BOYHOOD I HAD YET COME FORTH (84-121550-0022)
TO THE LEFT HAND I TURNED WITH THAT RELIANCE WITH WHICH THE LITTLE CHILD RUNS TO HIS MOTHER WHEN HE HAS FEAR OR WHEN HE IS AFFLICTED (84-121550-0023)
TO SAY UNTO VIRGILIUS NOT A DRACHM OF BLOOD REMAINS IN ME THAT DOES NOT TREMBLE I KNOW THE TRACES OF THE ANCIENT FLAME (84-121550-0024)
DANTE BECAUSE VIRGILIUS HAS DEPARTED DO NOT WEEP YET DO NOT WEEP YET AWHILE FOR BY ANOTHER SWORD THOU NEED'ST MUST WEEP (84-121550-0025)
I SAW THE LADY WHO EREWHILE APPEARED VEILED UNDERNEATH THE ANGELIC FESTIVAL DIRECT HER EYES TO ME ACROSS THE RIVER (84-121550-0026)
LOOK AT ME WELL IN SOOTH I'M BEATRICE (84-121550-0027)

THEREFORE MY ANSWER IS WITH GREATER CARE THAT HE MAY HEAR ME WHO IS WEEPING YONDER SO THAT THE SIN AND DOLE BE OF ONE MEASURE (84-121550-0029)
BUT BY THE LARGESS OF CELESTIAL GRACES WHICH HAVE SUCH LOFTY VAPOURS FOR THEIR RAIN THAT NEAR TO THEM OUR SIGHT APPROACHES NOT (84-121550-0030)

IL POPOLO E UNA BESTIA (8842-304647-0005)
THE PEOPLE IS A BEAST OF MUDDY BRAIN THAT KNOWS NOT ITS OWN FORCE AND THEREFORE STANDS LOADED WITH WOOD AND STONE THE POWERLESS HANDS OF A MERE CHILD GUIDE IT WITH BIT AND REIN ONE KICK WOULD BE ENOUGH TO BREAK THE CHAIN BUT THE BEAST FEARS AND WHAT THE CHILD DEMANDS IT DOES NOR ITS OWN TERROR UNDERSTANDS CONFUSED AND STUPEFIED BY BUGBEARS VAIN (8842-304647-0006)
